"will hold 40 GB, media is about 42 (ex vat)euros per tape HP do DDS-4 backup tape drives to take those but they're about 1236 euros (ex vat) and thats for an internal model (taken from DCB Groups catalogue). There are other brands and various other tape formats to choose from, but just to give you a rough benchmark of pricing for that sorta capacity.Ther are options that will go up to crazy capacities by using using multiple tapes in a caddy... of course its gonna cost a lot more.I'd also be ensuring I had some sort of disk mirroring set up also... the more redundancy the better (within reason).G.___________________________ Graham Smith, Network Administrator, Department of Computing, Institute of Technology, Tallaght, Dublin 24 Phone: + 353 (01) 4042840-----Original Message----- From: Ciaran Johnston [mailto:cj@nologic.org] Sent: 16 August 2002 15:09 To: ilug@linux.ie Subject: [ILUG] Backup solutions Hi folks, I maintain a colocated server on behalf of a small group of individuals, and am looking at backup solutions.

My ISP does offer backups at extra cost but the only problem with that is, well, the extra cost.What I was hoping to do was to install some kind of internal tape device, then swap tapes round every month, so I had an onsite backup of say the last 24 hours and an offsite backup of the last month. Is this feasible? I'm beginning to think it isn't.

"fw : summary rto week day 2 - - planning & expansion fyi . tj and claudette - - please forward to your groups . thanks . - - - - - original message - - - - - from : walton , steve sent : wednesday , october 17 , 2001 10 : 17 pm rto week day 2 - - october 16 , 2001 transmission planning & expansion the afternoon panel discussed transmission planning and expansion . the panelists were : jose degado - - ceo american transmission company , michael dworkin - - chair vermont psc , mark maher - - vp transmission business line , bonneville power administration , lara manz - - pse & g , masheed rosenqvist - - national grid , steve walton - - enron . general observations the commissioners were all present although the did leave and return from time to time . commissioner ' s breathitt and massey were the most active in questioning . the ferc staff were active in asking questions after the initial presentations , moving along the discussion by asking questions . there was some reference to the morning discussion of congestion management , however , there was no discussion of the merits of the various types of transmission rights . there was a good deal of consensus around the concept of the rto planning process being first a provider of information to the market ( where are problems , how might they be solved , etc . ) and that the where possible that expansion be funded by market participants who would benefit . there was a good deal of discussion of "" least cost planning "" and the identification of options which are not transmission related . all agreed there had to be backstop authority to build transmission , however then the challenge is who pays for it , which raises the need for dispute resolution . opening statements jose delgado : atc is a transmission only company with miso as the system operator . they view everyone as a customer whose needs are to be met . they were formed by divestiture by ious , coops and munis and with a $ 500 million asset base initially . their current ten year plan will add $ 1 billion of investment . their top priorities are connecting generation and load . michael dworkin : because transmission is a common good , construction affects all parties not just one party . the environmental and permitting of lines requires a balance of benefits with costs and a long range view . the idea of joint boards should be considered for dealing with multi - state projects , although ferc has show little interest in joint boards they have been used by fcc . state input needed because of the local needs and impacts which must be considered . mark maher : ferc must consider the unique characteristics of the west when considering congestion management . lmp is not a good fit to hydro systems with their multiple use obligations . rto west is developing a planning process which will give the rto the freedom to develop options as we learn in the future . the rto needs a strong centralized planning process . laura manz : the various aspects of planning are connected . pricing ( lmp ) is the key to getting the right signals for expansion of transmission and resources . no competitor should have an advantage over another . the rto needs a central planning process but it shouldn ' t push solutions . the market should decide on solutions . masheed rosenqvist : the morning discussion of congestion management talked about hedging against risk . the planning discussion is not about what we have now , but about how to avoid future congestion . the commission has taken conflicting positions in different cases . the issues that need to be answered are : how can merchant transmission be compensated ? should transmission projects be open to rfps ? is ferc open to market based pricing for expansions ? steve walton : the most important thing for ferc to do for expansion is to settle the matter of industry structure do away with the uncertainty that has frozen transmission investment . the rto debate has been going on for 5 years or more and needs to be settled . for expansion to go forward , there needs to be a clear property right which accrues to the expanding party . you are always going to have muddy issues in planning . for instance if a 138 kv line is all that is needed to day , but future considerations of scare right - of - way say a 345 kv line should be built , who pays for the extra cost . in order to resolve such matters the planning process must include a dispute resolution process , appeal able to ferc , to decide such matters . discussion kevin kelly asked about he fact that some parties benefit form current congestion so how does a stakeholder process get things built when some oppose . most agreed that if a party wants to fund construction it should be built with the beneficiaries funding . michael dworkin expressed concerns about use of eminent domain to build which means a benefit test must exist to say this is the best solution , i . e . least cost planning . this lead to discussion of the need for the rto to be provider of information to all parties so they can make intelligent decisions . commissioner massey asked about whether the system was ( a ) under built and needed lots of expansion so don ' t worry about overbuilding or ( b ) transmission planning should consider all options before construction of new facilities . the panel agreed that pricing needs to be a prime determinant in the process . michaela dworkin worried that overbuilding distorts decisions . laura manz felt that the term "" under built "" is a secondary effect of not having proper pricing of locational prices to guide parties . dick o ' neil asked if lmp will work in the west . mark maher said it wouldn ' t . laura manz said it applies everywhere because of physics , they manage hydro facilities in pjm . michael dworkin said lmp means an explicit measure of cost of congestion and the value of generation at locations and ought not to be rejected just intelligently designed . bpa is looking pricing model but lmp won ' t work . steve walton said lmp needed for real time dispatch , but given the nature of the northwest hydro system it must have some "" tweaks "" like bilaterals and allow operator self - schedule output levels to permit river coordination . hydro system optimizes over weeks and months to maximize firm energy production not on an hour to hour basis . pjm has hydro , but not 70 % as in the northwest . implementation will be different because such thing as unit commitment are different when you have primarily hydro and base load coal . in the summation at the end of the panel , four principles were listed : ( 1 ) rto must provide information , ( 2 ) rto should identify solutions , ( 3 ) rto should be unbiased and ( 4 ) the rto should be accountable . the disagreement was over the last two points , michael dworkin felt that # 3 ( unbiased ) was critical and that # 4 ( accountability ) was accomplished by having regulators involved in governance . jose delgado said and transco can ' t be unbiased since it provides services , although the iso above it can be , but accountability is based on loosing your investment if you make an mistake . this last point really comes down to a preference for iso over transco forms and the tension which exist because unbiased and accountability issues . steve",Safe Email

But there is a problem with making changes outside of exmh: the .xmhcache files 
don't get updated. This is dangerous; I have to remember to re-scan each folder

  Test the hub ports by switching cables around.
  Run ifconfig on the server - any errors and what kind they are.
  Test the network card... by replacing the thing!Seriously, if the server has a PCI slot free, something like a Realtek 8139
based card costs less than 20 euro.  The design is a couple of generations later
- more memory, less cruft, no *FSCKING* dos config utility, no jumpers on the
card and it's PCI.  Ronan.

"re : 5 . 1484 comparative syntax since chet creider 's posting of 8 dec rightly corrected some misinformation i gave in my off-the - top-of - the-head posting about karamojong , i decided to make amends by doing a little research ( very little ) to check the rest of what i said . consider it a xmas gift . below is the relevant section of recent nilo - saharan classification ( sudanic : nilotic ) . it 's basically the same as greenberg ( 1963 ) with some refinements in further branching but no rearrangement of limbs . east sudanic has four branches , including eastern and western , then nilotic with three branches , including west , east and south . karamojong belongs to the east branch of the nilotic branch of east sudanic . it is therefore classified as closer to maasai ( maa - lotuko branch ) and bari ( bari branch ) than to the lwo branch of the west branch of nilotic , but no closer to kalenjin , a group in the south branch ( e . g . , nandi ) than to the west branch . the following is a relatively recent classification , such as found in schadeberg 's ( 1981 ) article on nilo - saharanisch . central sudanic : moru - madi - lugbara etc east sudanic : eastern : nubian western : tama , daju kuliak : ik , so nilotic : west : ( some call it north nilotic ) burun : idem nuer - dinka : idem lwoo : north : shilluk , anwak south : achooli , luo east : ( some call it central nilotic ) bari : bari , kakwa etc maa - lotuko : maasai etc teso - turkana : karamojong , jie etc south : kalenjin : nandi - markweta : nandi , tuken elgon : sapiny , pok okiek / dorobo : sogoo etc datoga : etc beside the bewildering array of east and west branches of branches down the sudanic line i can trace my inaccuracy to conolly 's mention of jie . as a language , jie , along with karamojong and various other languages such as teso , are part of the teso - turkana branch of east nilotic . however , in an earlier classification , e . g . , crazzolara ( 1938 ) , jii is the name used for west nilotic ( or at least the current lwo and nuer - dinka branches ) . jii means "" people "" ( or "" ordinary people "" ) in most of the west nilotic languages , hence the classificational name . the dinka call themselves "" jieng ' "" . i suspect that the east nilotic jie ( also spelled "" jiye "" ) is the same word , but i have n't checked if the jie actually call themselves that . african language nomenclature is full of terms not used by the speakers themselves ( but often by sarcastic neighbors , so that , for example , while the dinka evidently see no stigma in their autonym , the achooli use the term somewhat like english uses the term "" the masses "" , cf . hoi polloi ) . just for fun let 's see how accurate what i said was about the numbers from one to ten are . we do n't need six through nine , because they are compounds of five plus numbers under five . the data for most languages are restricted to what i happened to have within reach without doing library research . however , the data for bari and teso ( ateso , in my experience ) are from transcriptions of recordings i made a long time ago in east africa before i even knew how these languages were classified . i do n't have published linguistic data on hand for them . in all cases i have simplified orthography for typographical ease ( losing information ) . for example , the "" h "" following a vowel refers to the retracted ( lax - sounding ) tongue root position of that vowel . the nilotic languages have complex vowel systems with "" tense "" and "" lax "" subsystems . of course , lexical numbers by themselves do not prove anything about genetic af finities . nevertheless , some interesting patterns emerge to compare with the currently accepted classification scheme . west nilotic : achooli anwak luo dinka nuer 1 ace : hl achyehloh achiel tok kehl 2 aryo : h areahu ariyo rou rahu 3 adeek adahgoh adehk diak dyohk 4 ang ' we : hn ang ' wehnoh ang ' wen ng ' wan ng ' wan 5 abiic abiyuh abihch dhiec dye : ch 10 apaar apar apar thiaar wahl the first consonant in ' 5 ' seems to be diagnostic of the distinctness of nuer - dinka from the lwoo group . otherwise , dinka ' 1 ' is wierd , and so is the first consonant of dinka ' 10 ' ( cf . dinka - nuer ' 5 ' ) , but not much wierder than a comparison of indo - european numbers ( cf . germanic ' 4 - 5 ' or slavic ' 9-10 ' ) . reconstruction is not difficult , although you do n't have an accurate transcription of the vowel distinctions ( or tone ) . east and south ( nandi ) nilotic : ( afro - asiatic : cushitic ) bari teso maasai nandi somali 1 kyeling ' diopeti -

"" pwahk "" fits in with the west nilotic set , but presumably g 's data comes from a published source . ( i have n't loo ked at my data since i transcribed it - - several decades , but i relistened to my bari tape to make sure i had n't transposed the word for ' 10 ' with some other word like ' toothbrush ' . ) by the way , teso is closely related to karamojong so i would expect the numbers to be similar , including the cushitic loan for ' 10 ' , but with doubts about whether karamojong ' 5 ' would follow the maasai or bari - teso pattern . ( gotta go to the library for this one . any volunteers ? ) the word for ' 10 ' in the other east and south nilotic languages was recognised by g as a loan from somali or one of the mutually intelligible galla languages of cushitic . that 's why i gave the somali numbers above . easy to see it would be a lot more difficult to argue for somali as nilotic than for the other languages [ uhm , if their other lexical correspondences behave like their numbers - - which they do . . . g actually uses the example of cushitic multiple of ten in maasai in his arguments against meinhof 's nilo - hamitic hypothesis . cushitic was part of "" hamitic "" in the older terminology ( "" afro - asiatic "" is g 's coinage for older "" semito - hamitic "" ) . . note nubian ' 10 ' below . . thus , g has been as sharp to use arguments about borrowing against his opponents as have his opponents against him . what to do ? east sudanic central sudanic nubian lugbara 1 we : rum aluh 2 awum iri 3 toskum na 4 kemsum su 5 dijum towi 10 dimnum muhdri wow ! numbers do n't help unite nubian as a branch of east sudanic with nilotic . obviously other criteria were used . for superifical impression nubian ' 10 ' looks promising as cognate with south and most of east nilotic , and maybe it is , but that card has already been played non-genetically above - - and with good reason . . g , p106 again , compares bari ' 10 ' "" mere "" with khordofan nubian "" bure "" for the same ) . as central sudanic , lugbara might be expected by the naive to be even more different from nilotic than nubian , but the numbers do n't show that . g uses lugbara ' 2 ' in his mass cognate sets for the unity of central and east sudanic . interestingly , he also uses dinka ' 1 ' , the wierd one for west nilotic , in the same mass cognate sets - - for comparison with ' 10 ' in some central sudanic groups . lots of interesting claims there , e . g . , the most common west nilotic word for "" one "" is not proto - west nilotic , let alone proto - nilotic ( despite the suggestiveness of bari and nandi ' 1 ' above ) . g could be right , for all i know . anyway , i ' m just as interested in the areal cross-currents as in the hypotheses about genetic relationships . thus , other implications emerge from g 's mass comparison s , e . g . , the pan - nilotic word for ' 4 ' must be an areal innovation ( maybe in proto - nilotic ) since it does not occur elsewhere in nilo - saharan , or in any other known language group for that matter . so , ok . we have some pretty strong hypotheses . i have n't followed nilo - saharan studies closely , though nubian , but the numbers do n't show that . g uses lugbara ' 2 ' in his mass cognate sets for the unity of central and east sudanic . interestingly , he also uses dinka ' 1 ' , the wierd one for west nilotic , in the same mass cognate sets - - for comparison with ' 10 ' in some central sudanic groups . lots of interesting claims there , e . g . , the most common west nilotic word for "" one "" is not proto - west nilotic , let alone proto - nilotic ( despite the suggestiveness of bari and nandi ' 1 ' above ) . g could be right , for all i know . anyway , i ' m just as interested in the areal cross-currents as in the hypothese about genetic relationships . thus , other implications emerge from g 's mass comparisons , e . g . , the pan - nilotic word for ' 4 ' must be an areal innovation ( maybe in proto - nilotic ) since it does not occur elsewhere in nilo - saharan , or in any other known language group for that matter . so , ok . we have some pretty strong hypotheses . i have n't followed nilo - sahara n studies closely , though west african niger - congo ( actually the benue - kwa grou p of niger - congo ) . greenberg ( 1963 ) notes that westermann also used the label for various east sudanic languages ( w had done some fieldwork on nilotic ) , beli eving that they were related to the west african niger - congo ( i . e .

"I recently stumbled across the contents of the journal, ""Electronic
Publishing"", which was published from January, 1988 through December, 1995.
All papers are available online in PDF (this was apparently one of the first
journals to disseminate in PDF, in 1994). The journal also reprints some of
the better papers from the Electronic Publishing conferences, held bi-yearly
from 1986-1992 (EP86, EP88, EP90, EP92).http://cajun.cs.nott.ac.uk/compsci/epo/papers/epoddtoc.htmlToday's reader might look at the contents and wonder about their relevance,
since they don't directly discuss the Web. As an academic, I find this
journal valuable, since the papers are of generally high quality (by top
researchers), and they provide lots of pointers to the evolution of the
ideas that led to many Web technologies.  It's one source among many for
sifting through the intellectual lineage of electronic publishing
technologies.Rohit and Adam might find the following papers especially relevant, in the
context of their WWW7 ""Evolution of Document Species"" paper:Page Description Languages: Development, Implementation and Standardization:

of French in primary school and 6 in secondary school. So, that's 9 years of
French. Which, I guess, should be long enough to be fluent in most languages.
As it turns out, my French is crap. My Irish is much better. The problem seems to be the braindead attempt to make people learn languages
they can't speak through reading and writing. And then tacking on speech as
an afterthought. Whereas doing it the other way round would be a lot more
useful...I hear this complaint a lot, but I never hear people complaining about being
""forced"" to learn to read and write, or to do maths. Maybe people don't mind
as much if it is perceived as a useful skill (which Irish is not usually
perceived as).Anyway, tir gan teanga tir gan anam :)Nick--

"sure what you're asking. Content-Type: message/rfc822 mails are handled like attachments and are not broken down further into mime parts. That is, the attachment is treated as one part. The headers and body of the message/rfc822 are sent to the server without parsing. The other way to handle it is to treat it like a regular mail, and break it down into parts. There are reasons to break it down and not to break it down, and right now we chose not to break it down.

Date: Not suppliedCarny concessionaires have taken to selling deep-friend Twinkies, doing big 
business with artery-clogging horripilations:     In what may be the biggest setback for the war on fat since supersize 
    fries, Americans are scarfing down thousands of the gooey, calorie-laden 
    snack cakes at county fairs and restaurants across the country.     ""We sold 26,000 Twinkies in 18 days. People drove for hours just to taste 
    our Twinkie,"" said Rocky Mullen, who sells the deep-fried, cream-filled 
    treats for $3 (U.S.) each at the Payallup Fair, 50 kilometres south of 
    Seattle.     As if Twinkies are not sweet enough already, vendors such as Mr. Mullen add 
    chocolate or berry sauce and sprinkle powdered sugar on top...     Hearing about Mr. Sell's invention, Hostess, the company that makes the 
    71-year-old snack, started promoting deep-fried Twinkies to state and 
    county fairs, where a captive population of junk-food addicts began 
    gobbling them up between pig races and tractor-pull competitions.     How bad are they for your health? After deep-frying, a Twinkie packs an 
    estimated 400 calories and 28 grams of fat.  Link[1] Discuss[2][1] http://www.globeandmail.com/servlet/ArticleNews/PEstory/TGAM/20020923/UFATTN/Headlines/headdex/headdexInternational_temp/13/13/22/

"lexical semantics in context : corpus , inference and discourse esslli-98 workshop on lexical semantics in context : corpus , inference and discourse august 17 - 21 , 1998 a workshop held as part of the 10th european summer school in logic , language and information ( esslli-98 ) august 17 - 28 , 1998 , saarbruecken , germany * * second call for papers * * organizers : johan bos ( saarbruecken ) and paul buitelaar ( brandeis university ) the workshop aims at bringing together research in two complementary fields of semantic analysis that are still too far apart . in order to achieve both a broad and a deep understanding of any given text document , a system needs both advanced acquisition of corpus specific lexical semantic knowledge and powerful inference mechanisms that utilize that knowledge in discourse analysis . given the still relatively limited results within both areas there has been little impetus to combine them . corpus - based extraction of lexical semantic knowledge has only recently become a more feasible task , because of the growing availibility of on-line text documents ; robust corpus processing technologies , such as broad coverage part-of - speech tagging and shallow parsing ; and readily available statistical methods . the various approaches to discourse analysis , originating in such diverse fields as formal semantics , psychology and ai , are in the process of converging into a unified approach to the analysis and representation of the cohesive structure of natural language documents . the intersection between these two fields lies in the application of lexical semantic knowledge to such problems in discourse analysis as anaphora resolution and discourse segmentation . in fact , the benefit will be mutual , because knowledge of discourse structure is helpful to lexical knowledge extraction as well . in summary , large scale domain specific lexical semantic knowledge acquisition can assist in analyzing discourse structures , which in turn can assist in acquiring even more accurate lexical semantic representations for the relevant terms in the domain . further information : to obtain further information please visit the workshop home page at http : / / www . cs . brandeis . edu / ~ paulb / esslli98 . html",Safe Email
"oil just hit record high , profit from delek - dlkr . ob oil for america has been successful in locating the reefs 33 out of 33 times ! delek ' s main project involves exploring for the mississippian aged lodgepole carbonate build - ups in the williston basin of montana and north dakota , as well as the hardeman basin in west texas . a new exploration technique is being applied to this play , which has proven succesfull . the lodgepole limestone was deposited in a very shallow ancestral williston basin . the carbonate formation was developed as thousands of small , circular limestone build - ups , or reefs . the average distribution of the build - ups is about 4 reefs per square - mile section . the lodgepole reefs were deposited within a fairway a thousand miles long and thirty miles wide on the shelf of the williston basin . the reservoirs in the williston basin may produce as much as 2 , 000 barrels per day ( bopd ) at depths of 7 , 500 to 9 , 500 feet . the most prolific reefs have each produced as much as 4 , 000 , 000 barrels of light , sweet oil . the lodgepole reefs are visible in surface outcrop in the far western part of the williston basin . this allows the sense of scale and geometry of the reefs can be observed first hand . delek resource ' s technology partner in this play is a company named oil for america ( ofa ) . ofa has applied a proprietary photo - analytical program known as all remote sensing analysis . this analysis detects the location of waulsortian reef cores . this program produces well - defined images that correlate with the oil producing wells . oil for america ' s first partner , conoco who was the major player in the lodgepole reef play , stated that the lodgepole reefs are the most economic production it has anywhere in the world . the average well in the united states produces a few barrels per day . each one of these lodgepole wells is so prolific that it amounts to a thousand of those wells . because each well may produce 2000 bod and 4 , 000 , 000 bo cumulatively from a single well - bore , well in excess $ 100 , 000 , 000 of revenue may be generated from a well in a relatively brief period of production . the potential for significant new discoveries in the williston basin began in february 1993 . from a wildcat well near dickinson , north dakota , conoco tested a heretofore non - productive interval in the lodgepole limestone . the carbonate zone had good porosity and gas shows , so after failing to find pay in their deeper objectives , a production test was reluctantly taken at 9 , 721 - 9 , 850 feet . the discovery well , dickinson lodgepole unit # 74 , initially produced at a rate of 419 bopd . the well has produced nearly 2 million barrels of 41 . 4 api gravity sweet crude oil and 1 . 2 bcf of natural gas to date . this discovery ignited a frantic race between 1993 and 1997 where major and independent oil companies attempted to develop and expand the lodgepole find using conventional 2 - d and 3 d seismic programs . the best wells flowed up to an allowable rate of 2 , 000 bopd . the conoco dickinson lodgepole # 75 is the single most productive well , having produced 4 , 000 , 000 barrels of oil and nearly 2 bcf of gas since september 1993 . this well still produces thousands of barrels a month after more than nine years of production . during this time , the lodgepole reef play became the largest onshore play in america . this success , however , was not without failure . the ability to seismically delineate discrete reefs has been very difficult and misleading . the geophysical characteristics of the lodgepole limestone are nearly identical with the overlying carbonate beds . this creates very poor acoustic contrast between the formations , so seismic differentiation between the formations is difficult . as a result , by 1996 the search for additional lodgepole reefs had stalled . the play was recently revitalized when continental resources made another accidental discovery in december 2000 in valley county , montana , 155 miles northwest of dickinson , north dakota . in this area the lodgepole reefs are shallower at 7 , 200 feet . this reef initially produced at 2 , 000 barrels per day , but has now begun producing water . it appears that the well was drilled on the flank of a reef , close to water . the discovery dramatically increases the exploratory opportunities for future discoveries in the lodgepole . oil for america has been successful in locating the reefs 33 out of 33 times ! , and has now begun using another technology to differentiate reefs that show signs of hydrocarbons , as to minimize the possibility of drilling a reef that would be a dry hole , and is confident that the three technologies applied overall makes the chances of drilling a successful producing reef excellent . using these technologies delek will drill those targets in the williston basin . delek intends to raise money , and acquire producing properties in the near term . the properties would complement the exploration as it will be in the same areas as the exploration the company is pursuing . symbol : dlkr . ob keep an eye out for upcoming breakings news !

"sum : c gemination ( syntactic ) content - length : 10885 summary of data on syntactic gemination of consonants a couple of weeks ago i posted a query on what i termed "" syntactic gemination "" , for which i got information from no fewer than 15 respondents . i am very grateful to them all . here they are , listed in alphabetical order : list of the 15 respondents : prathima christdas ( prathima . christdas @ um . cc . umich . edu ) vincent decaen ( decaen @ epas . utoronto . ca ) lance eccles ( lance . eccles @ mq . edu . au ) maik gibson ( llrgbson @ reading . ac . uk ) david gil ( ellgild @ nusvm . bitnet ) ralf grosserhode ( afrikanistik2 @ uni-bayreuth . de ) jacques guy ( j . guy @ trl . oz . au ) marcia haag ( haag @ monk . nhn . uoknor . edu ) mark robert hale ( hale1 @ alcor . concordia . ca ) bruce nevin ( bnevin @ lightstream . com ) john phillips ( john @ ccyi . ccy . yamaguchi-u . ac . jp ) mari siiroinen ( siiroinen @ cc . helsinki . fi ) norbert strade ( lingnost @ hum . aau . dk ) mark verhijde ( mark . verhyde @ let . ruu . nl ) caroline r . wiltshire ( wiltshir @ minerva . cis . yale . edu ) the term "" syntactic gemination "" was not specific enough , as i had in mind only gemination at word boundaries , and not word-internal gemination at morpheme boundaries . nevertheless i will mention such cases as have been pointed out by respondents . besides , in my haste , i had forgotten to mention classical greek , which i had also taken into account in the preliminary version of my paper . here are the data : a syntactic gemination at word-boundary a . 1 - italian this is the "" raddoppiamento sintattico "" of central and southern italian . nevertheless the conditions under which this appears seem to vary considerably among the dialects ( and the speakers ? ) . for instance , the example "" a casa "" [ a ' kkasa ] , taken from lepschy & lepschy ( 1981 ) is not accepted in the dialect of an italian colleague at my university . a . 2 & a . 3 - biblical hebrew and phenician in these languages the definite article / ha / triggers gemination of the initial consonant of the following word ( except for certain consonants ) . for instance , in bh , we have / su : s / ( horse ) , but / ha ssu : s / ( the horse ) . the same would seem to apply to phenician ( see the grammars by segert , van den branden ) , although we have only one epigraphic attestation in punic . the explanation is that a proto-article is reconstructed as * / han / or * / hal / , so that * / hal su : s / ) * / has su : s / , then reinterpreted as / ha ssu : s / . this hypothesis has been connected with the arabic data : the final c of the article / ? al / is assimilated to the initial c of the following word ( at least for the socalled "" sun "" cs ) . for instance : / ? as samak / ( the f ish ) . 46or arabic , gibson adds this : in tunisian arabic there is a clearer case ( @ is schwa ) : shaaf - @ t 's aw - 3sf ' "" she saw "" shaaf - @ tt-u 's aw - 3sf-3sm ' "" she saw him "" the doubling is done to maintain syllable structure , but this is not the20 normal way . we would normally expect the elision of @ , to shaaf-t - u , but20 this does not happen in the 3s feminine past . a . 4 - classical greek in attic greek word-initial / r - / goes to / rr - / under certain conditions after a word ending in a short final v . in epic texts , or in other dialects , this gemination is extended to other sonants : / l - , m - , n - / . we even find / pp - / attested in boeotian these four languages were the only instances known to me when i posted the query . incidentally , note that they are different from the cases of latin "" hic "" and "" hoc "" , which were pronounced / hikk / and / hokk / before a word beginning with a v . the form / hokk / is original ( and / hikk / analogically modelled after it ) , so that diachrony forces us to say that / hokk / is simplified into / hok / before a c - initial word . here are now the additional data kindly supplied by my respondents , which i paste freely . a . 5 - finnish ( eccles , siiroinen , strade ) there is consonant gemination at word boundaries in certain cases in finnish . it is morphologically conditioned though it is "" syntactic "" . several morphemes or forms trigger it : imperative 2nd person singular ( ota ' take ' / otas se ' take it ' ) , allative case ( annan sinulle ' i - give to-you ' / annan sinullek kirjan ' i - give to-you a book ' ) , most of the nouns ending in - e ( kirje ' a letter ' / kirjet tuli ' a letter arrived ' ) and so on . other examples : in some negative forms : * en mene sinne * ( i do n't go there ) , pronounced20 * en menes sinne * negation + v - stem + there verb ( go ) 20 1 . sg . the same in imperative : * a "" la "" mene sinne * ( do n't go there ! ) , 20 pronounced : 20 * a "" la "" menes sinne * neg . verb imp . 2 . sg . also in the so called "" 1 . infinitive "" : * ha "" nen pita "" isi tulla ta "" nne * ( he / she ought to20 come here ) , pron : * . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . tullat ta "" nne * 20 inf . 1 here 20 the background for this gemination is the historical loss of a final consonant in the suffix-less verbal stem and in the mentioned infinitive form . this consonant was assimilated to a following consonant . while it disappeared without any trace in an end position or in front of a vowel , the gemination of the following consonant was retained . this feature is n't marked in orthography . a . 6 & a . 7 - tamil and malayalam ( christdas , wiltshire ) tamil has gemination of word initial stops following words with some case markings ( accusative at least ) . a brief account can be found in christdas , prathima ( 1987 ) "" on constraining the power of lexical phonology : evidence from tamil "" in mcdonough , j . and plunkett ( eds ) proceedings of nels 17 , volume 1 : 122-146 . 20 syntactic gemination is also found in malayalam , a closely related language . a . 8 - celtic languages ( phillips ) the celtic languages have "" mutations "" , changes to the beginnings of words due to their syntactic environment . types of mutations include prefixing of h or n to a vowel and voicing , devoicing , nasalising , etc . , of consonants . one of the mutations in old irish was gemination . the welsh spirant mutation is historically cognate with irish gemination , e . g . ci "" dog "" , but tri chi "" three dogs "" , cath a chi "" a cat and a dog "" , though gemination in old irish occurred in a much wider range of environments . some of the mutations in breton are realised phonetically as gemination , though spelt otherwise . on other cases of c - mutation , see the mention by verhijede below ( fulla , southern paiute ) . a . 9 - the kelantan dialect of malay ( gil ) in the kelantan dialect of malay , agents of passive clauses ( ie . "" by "" - phrases ) are marked not with a preposition ( as in standard malay ) , but , rather , by gemination of the initial consonant . cb : if i understand this correctly , the preposition has been ellipted ? b - word - internal syntactic gemination word - internal syntactic gemination seems to be widespread , probably more than gemination at word-boundary . as pointed out by nevin , in many languages , some phonotactic effects apply only in certain syntactically defined domains , for example , in roots or in verb stems , but not in affixes . hale adds that the number of languages which show this process is quite large . for instance there are some oceanic examples . at any rate , both sanskrit and ( if the meter is to be believed ) and preclassical ( homeric ) greek show such processes . here are a few specific instances : b . 1 - classical greek word - internal / r / is geminated to / rr / after the augment or after a vowel in compounds , variably . b . 2 - choctaw ( haag ) choctaw ( a muskogean lg of n . america ) has an inflectional form ( for aspect marking ) that involves deformation of the stem such that a medial consonant is geminated , or / y / is inserted an geminated if there are not the requisite number of syllables . so we have falama ` return ' becoming fallaama ` finally return ' while ala ` arrive ' becomes ayyaala ` finally arriv e ' . b . 2 - sakao ( guy ) sakao is a language spoken at espiritu santo , , in vanuatu ( formerly new - hebrides ) . when the direct object is incorporated in the verb , the initial c of the verb is geminated . examples , with son 3d to hunt / shoot with a bow , enes 3d fish : moson enes 3d he is fishing fish with a bow ( now ) but : mossones 3d he fishes fish with a bow ( generally ) , il peche a l ' arc analysis : mv - 3eme p . sg . realis sson20 nes ( ( enes with disappearance of the compulsory article v - , then simplification of the two n 's inro one n ) nb : o 3d open o ( ipa "" open o "" in pullum & ladusaw , p . 117 ) e 3d open e ( ipa epsilon ) b . 3 - biblical hebrew gil adds this on hebrew : in biblical hebrew the 2nd binyan ( "" pi99el "" ) is formed by reduplication of the 2nd root consonant , together with the appropriate choice of vowels . now in most part , the binyan system is considered "" derivational "" and hence not , strictly speaking , syntactic ; however , in some cases , the 2nd binyan is the "" transitive "" or "" causitive "" of the first , in which case gemination ( plus vowel pattern ) does have a syntactic function . let me end by a more theoretical note , quoting verhijde : your question touches upon the fields of interaction between morphology-syntax and phonology ( prosody ) . now as far as i know , all c - gemination is in itself strictly phonological . thus if i understand your question correctly , you wish to find out whether there are languages that appear have morphological / syntactic triggers for c - gemination . there is a huge bulk of material on sandhi - effects , as for example the italian rs case you mentioned in your query . perhaps ellen kaisse ( 1985 ) , _ connected speech _ may be of some help . now with respect to your query : i was thinking ( from a phonological point of view ) that c - gemination is really : share melody . or in more abstract terms : share [ x ] . if this is correct , then for example c - mutation ( like in fula , southern paiute and celtic languages ) under syntactic considerations may become very interesting for you . thans again to all of you who generously answered my question . claude boisson universite lumiere , lyon , france ( claude . boisson @ mrash . fr )",Safe Email

of possible universes where the trust system is very sensitive

not economically worthwhile.  If you only filter 75% of spam, 
you're wasting your time.  Some people receive on the order of a 
10:1 ratio of spam:real mail -- 75% means the ratio adjusts to 
5:2 which is still shitty.  95% makes it 1:2, which is better.  
99% makes it 1:10 which is quite nice.  As the global ratio of 
spam:mail rises, this problem gets somewhat more important.  
With an order of magnitude worsening of the incoming spam:real 
ratio, 100:1, 99% effective still works OK.  75% effective is 
now really, really shitty.

would argue that any system will have a non-zero FP rate, 
including the ""no filter"" filter -- humans make mistakes too 
sometimes!  As spammer strategies evolve over time though, I'm 
fairly sure that SA will be able to adjust and compensate.  If

"california update 4 / 20 / 01 executive summary ? davis struggles to find senate support for socal transmission deal ? only chance of deal going through is a one - time quick vote ; if deal has to go to hearings - it will probably die ? if not transmission deal , legislators will seize assets and seek price caps ? asset seizure would target power contracts , then power plants ; as a result the endless court battles will ensue , but this gives davis opportunity to continue to blame generators and marketers ? bankruptcy for socal is still the most likely scenario , with the qfs or socal itself likely to file if the transmission deal dies or gets amended ? congressional democrats rally around davis and seize opportunity to blame the administration transmission deal and democratic support as governor gray davis scrambles to build support for his socal ed . transmission proposal , one thing is evident ; the longer the deal is exposed to public debate , the less likely it is to pass . in fact , politicians have been so leery of the deal that davis has been unable to locate even one sponsor to introduce the bill in the senate . in the eyes of many democratic legislators ( and all republicans ) forcing socal edison into bankruptcy is looking like a better option than buying the transmission lines ; that is why the governor ' s senior strategists have quietly been trying to schedule a quick "" up or down "" vote on the transmission line purchase as early as next week . the bill is currently not scheduled to be voted on in effort to avoid debate , however , if there is an opening within the next two weeks and davis feels he has enough support , it will be pushed through . because the socal deal needs every piece in place as "" negotiated "" by davis ' team , the team wants no amendments allowed on the assembly floor and a quick vote . if this unlikely fast track strategy fails for davis , the prospects for the transmission lines purchase will deteriorate steadily ( keep in mind that that it cannot even be resubmitted to the assembly until it has been vetted by socal edison attorneys ) . according to sources , the legislature is going to try to modify the memorandum of understanding between gov . davis and sce . however , the senate leadership does not believe there will be sufficient support to pass even a modified mou . burton reportedly believes that at least 6 democrats will vote against it along with the republicans . the more that bill gets picked apart in public , the uglier it looks and the more democrats will realize that they are all alone in supporting it . another problem faced by the legislatures is the deal is in favor of socal and not the state . among other things , the state is overpaying by about $ 1 . 5 billion for the transmission lines . additionally , the mou davis has with socal . ed nearly matches , point for point , the deal davis condemned with pg & e . asset seizures since before the pg & e bankruptcy filing , we have maintained that asset seizures through eminent domain would become a major pursuit for increasingly frustrated democrats . davis ' legal office has thoroughly scrubbed the law on eminent domain seizures of everything from power generating assets across california to existing power contracts negotiated by , whom davis ' s calls , "" profiteering power brokers "" . of course , everyone in the governor ' s office understands that any seizing would immediately end up in state and federal courts , and would be a legal nightmare ( there are a few minor constitutional , legal and interstate commerce problems ) . the main thing is that the seizing would continue davis ' s main approach to this problem - - management by press conference - - and it would put the governor and democrats on the right side of the issue - - punishing the capitalist leeches . according to one senior democratic legislator , there is movement within democratic members of the state assembly to demand that davis agree to seize the power contracts in return for their vote in favor of the power transmission purchase . of course , taking the contracts would only be setting a precedent for taking the power plants . the appeal of seizing the contracts is that it would allegedly put california state officials in charge of where the power is sold and reduce mark - ups substantially as they used the contract power authority to provide spot - market power purchases before peak emergency conditions drive the price through the roof . price caps one strong indication as to whether or not summer price caps will occur depends powerfully on decisions made by the three republican governors from colorado , alaska and wyoming . these three were the key players during the portland western governor ' s conference last january and , according to senior white house officials , it took the personal and prolonged intervention of president bush himself to peel these three away from an otherwise unanimous call for price caps from the governors . "" if they had signed that price cap appeal , "" the administration source said , "" we would already have price caps . so if they start to make it clear something has changed , we will have to listen . "" sources indicate that if these republican leaders begin to rethink their opposition to price caps , the bush administration will be forced to reconsider price caps as a remedy for the west . cost plus caps - - think of these as republican price caps in that their first duty is to make sure private companies make money and have incentives to provide power into the affected grid . just to give some idea of magnitudes in a cost plus deal , current discussions would put a cap on power costs at something like $ 250 per kilowatt hour . that is a long way down from the august futures contract that is pricing in $ 750 per kilowatt hour , but a long way above last august ' s $ 150 / kwhr price and a particularly long way above the cost of generating this power , which is something like $ 25 - 30 / kwh . market - price exceptions - - the option allows the bush administration to have political credit for imposing price caps . as we write , ferc is currently , in the process of considering permit renewals for five companies generating power in california ( duke , dynegy , aes , reliant and williams ) . the permit grants a further three - year waiver that allows them to sell power into california in the existing "" whatever price the market will bear "" . in other words , ferc could simply not grant these companies the right to sell energy at the market price , perhaps by changing a definition of controlling market share , and then power to control prices would revert back to ferc . technically , in granting the extension of these permits , ferc has to establish a formal finding that the five power companies do not wield "" market power "" - - that means they cannot affect the price of energy by withholding power at crucial times . of course , ferc has just found on three different rulings in the last four months that the companies wield exactly that kind of ability over market prices and has ordered minor rebates to adjust for the subsequent price spikes . but that would mean ferc would have to want to wield effective power over price capping in california and they have shown no desire on that front . the escape clause for ferc simply to renew the waivers is that they are routinely renewed unless the company applying for waivers controls more than 20 % of an electricity market and none of these companies come close . in other words , the waivers option lets ferc escape if the bush administration and ferc commissioners really want to escape . once again , that decision may be more in the hands of the three republican governors than anywhere else in the country . but you can be certain that in the past few days administration officials have become fully aware of the potential political liabilities of doing nothing except advocating more nuclear and coal power plants . democrats seize opportunity to blame bush senior political leaders now think the total energy bill for the year could come in as high as $ 60 billion , which would destroy state finances for a decade . add to that the constant drumbeat of numbers that voters hear everyday about their own direct out - of - pocket electricity costs ( they paid $ 7 billion for electricity in 1999 , $ 27 billion in 2000 and are expected to pay $ 70 billion this year - - ten times the rate two years ago . then , of course , they open bills with massive rate increases that bring all those incredible numbers home in a very direct way , and , well , who can blame the democrats for saying there is a simple solution , but the white house won ' t allow it . national level democrats realize california ' s power crisis is a prime opportunity to chastise the bush administration and its free - market advocate , ferc chairman hebert , over their resistance to summer price caps . as california ' s leaders calculate this year ' s taxpayer energy bill at potentially $ 60 billion , a rogue ' s gallery of democratic congressional leaders are currently meeting with governor davis and coordinating efforts to fan out across the eight western states of the power grid with a singular message : "" the solution to all western voters electricity problems lies right in washington dc , at ferc headquarters controlled by bush administration appointees . "" and as the political dialogue takes on a more aggressive national tone and its possible impact on control over the us congress comes more into focus , the solutions articulated by california ' s democrats who sense they have republicans on the run in the west become less and less "" free market "" focused . the two strains of the democratic solution that are becoming an unavoidable part of the energy picture are asset seizures and price caps .",Safe Email

Juniper beat estimates by earning less than $500,000, reported a 42 percent decline in year-over-year sales and offered little hope that it could grow its business when it reported 2002 second-quarter earnings on Thursday. Yet in some corners of the industry, Juniper's performance was viewed as mildly positive.

"accuracy of historical reconstruction in writing in linguist 5 . 1393 on another topic , martinha @ fub46 . zedat . fu-berlin . de ( martin haspelmath ) says : ) it is true that latin syntax could hardly be reconstructed from ) modern romance languages , but neither could latin morphology , and ) even the view of latin phonology that we would get from romance is ) very distorted . our reconstruction of protolanguage grammar is ) always imperfect . . . in looking at historical reconstruction done for s . american languages ( largely phonological ) , i ' ve often wondered about this . just how much could we trust the reconstructions that we did ? one of my rules of thumb for those languages was that if an item was longer than one syllable , it was suspect as being polymorphemic , and if it was longer than two syllables it was almost certainly polymorphemic . the problem is that most attempts at reconstruction ignored this areal phenomenon ( sometimes because the data was simply unavailable ) . from what i know of romance languages , i would say polysyllabic morphemes are more common there . if anything , that should make it easier to reconstruct latin , since you have more to work with . ( of course , the morphology of romance languages is much better known than that of the languages of s . america , which also helps ! ) so if latin would be very imperfectly reconstructed , what hope is there for native american languages ? has anyone ever attempted , as an exercise in the comparative method , reconstruction of latin from the romance languages , then compared the results with the real thing ? or reconstruction of any other attested language from its descendents ?",Safe Email

Date: 2002-10-03T14:42:29-05:00_Jeffrey Zeldman_: Party like it's 1997[1]. â€œMicrosoft has redesigned. 
Its new layout uses font tags and other deprecated junk straight out of the 
mid-1990s. ... When a W3C member company that helped create XHTML and CSS 
ignores or misuses those web standards on its corporate site, you have to 
wonder who didn't get the memo.â€ The new design also fails even the most basic accessibility tests[2]; the home 
page contains 80 instances of images without ALT text. This is the same basic 
failing for which the Sydney Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games was 
successfully sued in 2000[3]. Here is what microsoft.com looks like in a text-only browser[4]. (To better 
understand the experience, take a piece of paper and cover your entire monitor 
except for the top line, then scroll the window slowly so you can only read one 
line at a time.) While nothing is technically locked out (all the links are 
regular links, nothing requires Javascript to function properly), all the 
un-ALT-enhanced images (which are mostly spacer images and images-as-bullets) 
add so much clutter to the page that it's very difficult to navigate. Meanwhile, I don't want to imagine what it would sound like through a screen 
reader. Want to find the search box? That's â€œ1pttrans dot gif 1pttrans 
dot gif search for 1pttrans dot gif 1pttrans dot gif form edit box 1pttrans dot 
gif submit button go 1pttrans dot gif link advanced search 1pttrans dot gif 
...â€ And I hope you weren't looking for Microsoft's accessibility home 
page[5]; it's the 76th link on the page (out of 76).[1] http://www.zeldman.com/daily/0902b.html#prince

Copies, Webcasts tangled in draft bill Legislators are readying a bill that could sharply limit Americans' rights relating to copying music, taping TV shows, and transferring files through the Internet.
At the same time, the draft legislation seen by CNET News.com would place the struggling Webcasting industry on firmer legal footing.

 | Read Full Story Sharp's Zaurus PDA suffers security holesSharp's Linux-based, business-oriented Zaurus handheld suffers from security holes that could let hackers grab private data off a corporate network, according to researchers at Syracuse University.
In an advisory posted Wednesday to a Syracuse University computer-science Web site, researchers said they had found vulnerabilities in Sharp's Zaurus SL-5500 and Zaurus SL-5000D handhelds. The flaws let attackers take control of the device's file system, giving them the power to overwrite files or lock the device so no data can be input through the keypad or touch screen.

 | Read Full Story Outlook plug-in could let the hackers inA widely used plug-in for Microsoft's Outlook e-mail client that lets users encrypt and digitally sign messages has inadvertently weakened security and left the mail program open to attack.
Security company eEye Digital Security issued a warning late Wednesday to users of Network Associates' Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) plug-in for Outlook, saying that a vulnerability in the add-on could let attackers execute malicious software on a victim's computer. Network Associates released a patch for the problem Wednesday as well.

ACLU: Don't rat out your customersA clutch of civil liberties groups is asking small Internet service providers to get a backbone and stand up to companies seeking to unveil anonymous critics.
A group including the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), and the Center for Democracy and Technology is urging ISPs to alert customers when they are the targets of so-called John Doe legal actions, which try to unmask the identities of people who anonymously air their companies' dirty laundry. The group has sent letters to more than 100 ISPs, asking them to adopt a written policy promising to let customers know if they're targets.

 | Read Full Story Shareholders sue PayPal, eBayThe PayPal-eBay merger has hit an early snag: Two shareholder lawsuits have been filed against the companies seeking to block the deal.
The lawsuits, each filed in Delaware Chancery Court earlier this week on behalf of PayPal shareholders, charge that the deal represents a breach of the companies' fiduciary duty to those shareholders and that the price eBay is paying for PayPal is unfair and inadequate, the companies said in separate regulatory filings on Thursday.

> Why so fast?  Normal terminal velocity is much slower.Terminal velocity can be calculated by $v_{T} = \sqrt{\frac{2mg}{CpA}}$
where C is an experimentally determined coefficient, p is the density of the
air, and A is the area of the object. These calculations only work if the
object is blunt and the airflow is turbulent, blah blah blah. Terminal velocity
for a skydiver actually varies with how the diver holds themselves -- you go
faster if you pull yourself into a cannonball. That is the ""A"", for the
most part. All else being equal, the terminal velocity is inversely proportional to the
square root of air density. Air density drops off pretty quickly, and I 
really should be doing something other than digging up the math for that. I
think it involves calculus to integrate the amount of mass as the column of
the atmosphere trails off. I grabbed the other stuff directly out of a book :).In '87 a guy named Gregory Robertson noticed a fellow parachutist Debbie 
Williams had been knocked unconscious. He shifted so that he was head down,
hit about 200 mi/h, and caught up with her and pulled her chute with 10 seconds

"Hi,I'm going to be using MySQL in an upcoming project (and probably
buying their support license), and I'm wondering if anyone else
has used any libraries to link a proprietary C++ project to a
MySQL database. From what I can see on the MySQL website, their
MySQL++ library is under the GPL, but there's also some documents
which list it as under the LGPL.Anyone got any experience with this, or has used a different
library to link C++ and MySQL under Linux?Regards,Vin

this very subject.  He, like you, thinks that things like MMS are going to 
change the world.  I am not convinced.What exactly about sending pictures to each other is going to have such a 
huge impact?  I'm waiting to be convinced.  I just don't see how it changes 
human communication in any really amazing way - and no one who believes it 
has yet done a good job explaining it to me.  I can understand SMS taking 
off, since communicating short text messages can be very useful in many 
situations.  However, I just don't see what's the compelling reason for 
sending pictures around to each other on a regular basis.  Are there 
instances when it makes sense?  Sure, I can think of plenty where it's a 
nice to have, but very few where it would be a ""man, I need this"" type of 
feature.I mean, right now, at my desk, it's easy for me to text message with lots 
of people, and I do all the time.  If I wanted to, I could also very easily 
snap a picture and send it to them, but I don't.  I did once, after I got a 
really bad haircut, and a friend wanted to see how it looked - but that's a 
fairly limited use.  Obviously, that's just one case, and maybe I'm just 
too old (argh!) to really ""get"" this new photo taking and sharing stuff, 
but I'm really trying to understand.So, I'm not saying it won't be a ""fundamental change in human

"Hi all,
      I have an ISA PNP card that will use io 0x200 if available.  If located at
0x200 the card never works, at 0x210 it always does.  I suspect the problem is
the soundcard (Creative SB PCI-64) gameport controller, which also seems to live
here.  I'm not using the controller, so it doesn't show in /proc/ioports, so
autodetect happily puts my ISA card there.
      I can get the card to work easily enough using isapnptools, banning the
0x200 range in /etc/isapnp.gone, and then using ""insmod radio-cadet io=0x210"",
but I'd like to get the autodetect working, so what I think I'm looking for is
some way of adding ""don't go here, don't bother me"" entries into /proc/ioports.Anybody?TIA,
Ronan.

"workshop on embedded mt systems ( call for papers ) * * * * * * * * * deadline extension announcement * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * new submission deadline : august 24 , 1998 workshop announcement - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - workshop on embedded mt systems call for papers design , construction , and evaluation of systems with an mt component wednesday , october 28 , 1998 ( preceding the amta 98 conference ) sheraton bucks county hotel , langhorne , pennsylvania introduction as the strengths and weaknesses of machine translation ( mt ) engines have become better understood and accepted , there has been a marked increase in the development of computer systems with an embedded mt component . one consequence of this shift to "" embedded mt "" is that researchers , developers , as well as users have begun pushing the limits on the input that such systems will accept for translation . in so doing , a new class of problems has surfaced : any input - - - whether it appears in physical form on paper , in electronic form on-line , or mixed in with another modality such as graphics or video - - - will bring with it some unknown mix of noisy natural language data as well as non-linguistic data . how are systems with an mt component to be designed and evaluated given the challenge this input brings ? the objective of this workshop is to examine and evaluate techniques for adjusting this "" linguistic impedance mismatch "" between the real-world input and the natural language input expected by various mt engines . thus the workshop will focus on computational approaches to preprocessing system input for mt engines and on statistical methods for evaluating systems with an embedded mt component . linguistic preprocessing in image data for researchers working with image data , there is currently underway an effort to augment ocr ( optical character recognition ) engines with linguistic data as they recognize and convert bitmap data into characters - - - similar to what has already been done in speech recognition with linguistic data in hmms ( hidden markov models ) . other ocr researchers have also experimented with image-level early topic detection using word-shape recognition . in principle , this could provide a first-step filtering of documents into a more homogeneous mt input set , a desirable goal for mt evaluation . thus we expect that individuals working with or intending to incorporate ocr into their computer systems will be interested in this new area . linguistic preprocessing in online data for those working with online input , even though the characters are already present , there often still remains the task of preprocessing meaningful , symbolic character strings that are not a part of the text to be translated . for some systems , the rules for identifying and encapsulating or removing such strings may need to be hand-crafted over time as mt engine limitations surface . for others , a combination of hand-crafted rules and statistically trained nl models has worked . many have observed that the html annotations , alphanumeric items , spreadsheet and word processing codes are harder to weed out than originally expected . research efforts with the low-density and less-commonly taught languages , as well as more common ones , encounter a substantial problem with variation in spelling conventions and transcription preferences . for those natural languages that are primarily spoken and not written , for example , this is frequently the case . researchers working on this class of problem have built variants on spell checkers ( sc ) , components that standardize words to one orthography ( spelling convention ) before submitting it to an mt engine . an idea that has arisen for this component is to build in an option to adjust the level of sc correction - - - as would be relevant when input after ocr nonetheless varies from very noisy to relatively clean . evaluation of embedded mt systems among those working on statistical methods for evaluating systems with an embedded mt component , we have seen two distinct trends . one group of statisticians has begun looking for appropriate models from outside the world of mt evaluation , examining the efforts by others to take distinct metrics for components and combine them for an overall system-level metric using fuzzy mathematics . another group of researchers is looking instead at developing a one-dimensional scale for ranking mt engines along a continuum defined by system-level function . that approach , for example , might rank one engine as good enough for filtering documents , while another engine deemed more linguistically robust would be ranked higher because it could generate a good enough initial translation for subsequent post-editing . we welcome other functional evaluations of mt components and computer systems with embedded mt components as well . submissions submitters are invited to send in a short paper , not more than 5 pages , addressing one or more of the three areas discussed above . papers should define the problem in an embedded mt system that is the focus of the work , describe the embedded mt system design ( a simple sketch ) with sample input data where relevant , and present their approach to the problem . work at various stages of completion is acceptable ; we expect the current status of the work to be made clear . submission of end-to - end output of an embedded mt system is especially encouraged . the papers will be collected and distributed to participants of the workshop . ideally , the result of the workshop will be a clearer delineation of : ( 1 ) the range of linguistic preprocessing problems ( 2 ) the range of designs in embedded mt systems ( 3 ) how these problems are treated in different embedded mt systems ( 4 ) the metrics that are being used to evaluate these systems and their components . dates notice of interest in participation : july 10 , 1998 ( to voss @ arl . mil ) please identify which of the three areas you intend to address : preprocessing in image data , preprocessing in online data , evaluation of embedded mt systems . position paper submission : august 10 , 1998 note : now , august 24 , 1998 notifications : september 10 , 1998 note : now , september 17 , 1998 final copies of papers : october 10 , 1998 workshop : october 28 , 1998 submissions may be in printed or electronic form . submissions should be sent to : clare voss army research laboratory amsrl-is -

"full circle : asps the new big blue ? network world fusion focus : mike jude and nancy meachim on application service providers today ' s focus : full circle : asps the new big blue ? 03 / 15 / 00 dear wincenty kaminski , today ' s focus : full circle : asps the new big blue ? by mike jude and nancy meachim the terms  & asp  8 and  & ibm  8 may have more in common than being three - letter acronyms . remember big blue of the early  + 60 s ? the vision , then , was centralized computing . mainframe computers hosted complex , expensive applications that end users accessed via dumb terminals . it infrastructure , especially memory , was expensive and needed to be controlled . with computing resources centralized , ibm reasoned , they were easier to maintain . of course , ibm got it wrong , in that computers became a cheap commodity . and users weren  , t happy simply using dumb terminals . they wanted a bigger share in all that technology offered . so , as memory prices fell , so did the idea of central control . dumb terminals were transformed into intelligent desktop machines that could store applications and data . the glass house populated by white - smocked technicians went out of fashion . looking back on those times , many of us would shake our heads and wonder how ibm could have been so wrong . but maybe big blue wasn  , t so far off . thanks to the advent of application service providers , centralized computing is making a comeback . asps offer centralized application management . the market started as a way to offer the benefits of server advertisement protocol and other complex enterprise resource planning software to small companies or companies with less technical savvy . but asps now host all kinds of applications , including small , multilicensed programs whose images are downloaded to end users on demand . but , the principle remains the same : central control makes support much more efficient and usually cheaper . how about that , ibm ? to be fair , the dynamics of an asp are very different from old centralized mainframe operations . an asp doesn  , t just host and support an application for general distribution over an in - house proprietary network . unlike the ibm vision , an asp is very dependent on network service . it is also very sensitive to service levels . in the  + 60 s , if the mainframe let you down , you ended up twiddling your thumbs for an hour or so , and your only recourse was that white - smocked fellow . nowadays , users start to scream if service is interrupted for even a minute . and woe to the asp who brings down a customer operation . the world of the asp is much more complex than that of the old  + 60 s shop . however , if one could magically transport a computer user from the  + 60 s to the wonderful new 2000 s , would it seem all that different to him ? in an ideal asp world , a la scott mcnealy  , s vision , users would sit down at a semidumb terminal , download the application du jour , and start working . what did the  + 60 s user do ? kind of the same thing ! so you are probably wondering , what is the point ? just this : ibm  , s problem was leaving the customer out of the equation . and look what happened . customers rebelled . they didn  , t buy ibm  , s spiel . it became the  & in  8 thing to hate ibm . why ? because the guys in white smocks couldn  , t spell service and didn  , t care about customers . to be successful , asps need to learn from the past . they need to tattoo service on the forehead of each of their employees . there are too many choices , today , for customers to put up with inferior service . that  , s one big difference from the  + 60 s . customers now can literally choose any service provider in the world . just being big doesn  , t cut it these days . to contact mike jude and nancy meachim : - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - senior consultant michael jude and research director nancy meachim are with enterprise management associates in boulder , colo . , ( http : / / www . . com ) , a leading analyst and market research firm focusing exclusively on all aspects of enterprise management . jude has over 18 years of experience in the telecommunications industry , most recently with us west , where he was a manager of public policy . mike can be reached at mailto : jude @ . com . meachim focuses on e - business management . she is currently conducting a research study on asp management that is due to be released in april . nancy ' s email address is mailto : meachim @ . com . for related links - - click here for network world ' s home page : http : / / www . nwfusion . com buzz : application otsourcing , network world fusion , 09 / 27 / 99 asp research page , network world all about asps information center for application service providers , their customers and delivery partners . includes resources , events and news . the asp industry consortium . http : / / www . aspindustry . org / subscription services to subscribe or unsubscribe to any network world e - mail newsletters , go to : to change your email address , go to : subscription questions ?

"re : amendment to im ii ppa todd and louise , with respect to no . 1 below , i will check with mike curry to get his view on "" contract intent "" . with respect to no . 2 and no . 3 , the answer is absolutely "" no "" as they are material changes to the contract that have significant value issues . since i personally requested these changes to the original contract ( in the negotiation process ) , i know what the contract intent was and continues to be . if aep is still the equity buyer , they have complete control over the "" grid curtailment "" and associated termination risk in item no . 2 since they are the transmission owning utility in the region . the total epmi ppa ( as of 9 / 17 cob ) value is currently $ 18 . 5 million . my estimate for ppa value erosion for amendments no . 2 and no . 3 is $ 8 - 10 million . obviously , the $ erosion value is somewhat subjective , however , the transmission risk / grid curtailment risk on this project is significant and the termination event for grid curtailment is essential to mitigate what could be substantial downside for epmi . the reason i had mike ensure this provision was in the current ppa was to shift some of that risk back to enron wind and now enron wind is trying to push it to the project lenders ( who also don ' t want the risk ) . - - - - - original message - - - - - from : lindholm , tod a . sent : mon 9 / 17 / 2001 5 : 54 pm to : presto , kevin m . ; curry , mike ; lamb , john ; payne , michael cc : murphy , harlan ; kitchen , louise subject : re : amendment to im ii ppa kevin , ewc requires three clarifications to the ppa in order to get the project financed and sold . all previously requested amendments proposed by the equity purchaser have been dropped , and ewc will take the resulting pricing reduction . i want to make sure you understand how minor these three clarifications are . these clarifications conform to the original deal and are not changes to the deal . 1 . banking provisions . ewc and epmi agreed that energy and renewable energy credits ( "" recs "" ) produced by the indian mesa ii wind generating facility in any year in excess of the annual minimum quantity would , on a cumulative basis , offset any deficiencies of energy and recs in subsequent years . section 4 . 04 of the agreement does not clearly provide the cumulative carryover mechanism which was contemplated by the parties . ( this section originally provided for the carryover , but in an effort to simplify the language , the aggregate carryover concept was clouded . ) both the project lenders and the proposed equity purchaser have required that the point be clarified . there has never been a disagreement between epmi and ewc on the intention of the carryover banking provisions . epmi ' s most recent refusal to make this clarification now appears to be a change in the original deal 2 . grid curtailment ewc and epmi drafted the contract with specific provisions relating to termination resulting from grid curtailment , section 5 . 04 . there is an ambiguity in that grid curtailment could also be covered under the termination provision relating to force majeure under section 5 . 02 . this inconsistency is the problem . neither ewc nor epmi were to pay damages to the other party in the event of grid curtailment . the proposed equity purchasers have requested that the force majeure provisions of the ppa be clarified to make it clear that extended grid curtailment would not give rise to termination payments . this clarification is consistent with the original intent of the parties and is not a change to the deal . 3 . epmi credit support . epmi ' s obligations under the ppa are guaranteed by enron . the indian mesa ii ppa permits epmi to assign the ppa to certain affiliates without consent of the seller . any assignment by epmi would not relieve it of its duties and obligations under the contract , and the enron guarantee would remain in place . however , the project lenders have required clarification that the enron guarantee would either explicitly remain in place or that the assignee would have a credit quality at least as good as enron corp ' s credit quality . the project lender ' s have also requested that the termination payment provisions be clarified to provide that any substitute ppa used to calculate a termination payment would also need to be with a party that had a credit quality similar to enron corp ' s , since that is the credit that is supporting the indian mesa ii ppa . this will not affect the value of the contract to a third party since enron bears this obligation unless released by the project . under the dispute resolution provisions of the ppa we could certainly pursue declaratory relief under arbitration . our sense is that this does nothing but ensure delay . from an enron perspective : the sale of the equity and the financing of the non - recourse debt on the indian mesa ii project is currently at a standstill due to issues surrounding the ambiguities in the ppa while the debt financing for the indian mesa i project is in place ( different offtaker ) the proposed equity sale to aep is linked to the sale of the indian mesa ii project . if enron cannot move forward with the financing of the project within the next month , enron will likely end up with approximately $ 153 m less cash at year end than it counted on in its plan , in addition to any decrease in planned earnings the after - tax return to enron in a "" hold "" situation is 0 % , due to enron being in the alternative minimum tax position , i . e . it cannot use the tax benefits . it was clear in the discussions with the city of san antonio that these clarifications would have had no affect on value . tod - - - - - original message - - - - - from : presto , kevin m . sent : saturday , september 15 , 2001 2 : 41 pm to : curry , mike ;

support it, that's a serious problem with the business model; but that is
nobody's problem but Habeas's.A possible solution is for Habeas's business model to include some kind of

its incarnations) and MIMEDefang and several other MTA plugins all reject
at SMTP time messages that scores higher than some threshold (often 10).  
If some new release were to start scoring all spam no higher than 5.1,
there'd better be _zero_ FPs, because all those filters would drop their
thresholds to 5.On Thu, 29 Aug 2002, Michael Moncur wrote:> But I agree that there needs to be more focus on eliminating rules that

of at least 20 over what the market will bear, IMO -- on a per-message
basis for most typical mailing lists (Lockergnome, say) to afford it.On Thu, 29 Aug 2002, Harold Hallikainen wrote:> Habeus has come up with a very clever way to use existing law to battle

and effectively-enforced enough to be absent from spam, such that, e.g.,
SA could assign a positive score to messages that do NOT have it, then
spammers are out of business and Habeas has no one to sue.  There's nobody
left to charge except the people who want (or are forced against their
will because their mail won't get through otherwise) to use the mark.Conversely, if there are enough spammers forging the mark for Habeas to
make all its income suing them, then the mark is useless for the purpose
for which it was designed.Either way it seems to me that, after maybe a couple of lawsuits against
real spammers and a lot of cease-and-desist letters to clueless Mom&Pops,
then either (a) they're out of business, (b) they have to sell the rights
to use the mark to increasingly questionable senders, or (c) they've both
created and monopolized a market for ""internet postage stamps"" that
everybody has to pay them for.The latter would be quite a coup if they [*] could pull it off -- they do
absolutely nothing useful, unless you consider threatening people with
lawsuits useful, yet still collect a fee either directly or indirectly
from everyone on the internet -- effectively we'll be paying them for the
privilege of policing their trademark for them.  I don't believe they'll
ever get that far, but I don't particularly want to help them make it.[*] And I use the term ""they"" loosely, because the whole company could 
consist of one lawyer if it really got to that point.-------------------------------------------------------

disclaimers need to context-specific. (see 1.)3. there is precedence that blanket disclaimers, under UK law, have 
no standing and that rather (common sense this) it is the context of 
the situation that determines the legal effects of an email.See the norwich union case. Anyway, my top tips to help superiors who've fallen for disclaimers 
to see sense:1. server side appends breaks email standards. (unless always done 
correctly - nearly impossible, cause then server has to understand 
every possible type of client encoding).1a. it /does/ break certain types of encryption, that depend on the 
body being untouched. (eg X.509? kate brought this up ages ago).1b. iirc, it contravenes MIME to pre/append non mime-typed text. Most 
mailers will work around this and display the mail 'correctly', some 
might not though. Eg the message might not be displayed, or the 
disclaimer might not be displayed.1c. the correct place for disclaimers is on the client side. this 
also allows the user to select appropriate disclaimer for appropriate 
context (or no disclaimer at all).2. blanket appended disclaimers are of dubious legal effectiveness. 
(dilution, NU case in UK)3. generic disclaimer text is of dubious legal effectiveness. indeed
it will often be completely inappropriate ('this message is
confidential' on list mail). see 1c. Also, it needs to be written by 
an actual lawyer.4. A lot of big multinational corporations do /not/ append 
disclaimers. (ones i know of: Compaq (deceased), Motorol (iirc), 
Microsoft (iirc)).Useful link:http://www.goldmark.org/jeff/stupid-disclaimers/
(and see links at bottom of this page).finally, if you cant get reason to prevail and you have to agree to
implementing server side disclaimers, you can still resort to:	""that'll be done just as soon as the company stationary has
	disclaimers printed on them. oh, and i guess we'll have to play a
	disclaimer before or after all our telephone calls too? 
	Wait, that would cause a problem for faxes wouldnt it?""> kevinDisclaimer: IANAL, all the above might be wrong, i might even be 
intentionally misleading you. who knows.. go check it out for 
yourself.regards,

"bless you dear from : mrs . esther alan buch , please endeavour to use it for the children of god . i am the above named person from malaysia but now undergoing medical treatment . i am married to late dr . alan george buch who worked with malaysia embassy in south africa for nine years before he died in the year 2003 . we were married for eleven years without a child . he died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days . before his death we were both born again christians . since his death i decided not to re - marry or get a child outside my matrimonial home which the bible is against . i got your contact from a christian journal . when my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of $ 8 . 6 million ( eight million six hundred thousand u . s . dollars ) in my name with one finance / security company in europe . presently , this money is still with the financial company in europe . recently , my doctor told me that i would not last for the next four months due to cancer problem though what disturbs me most is my stroke . having known my condition i decided to donate this fund to church or better still a christian individual that will utilize this money the way i am going to instruct here in . i want a church or individual that will use this to fund churches , orphanages propagating the word of god and to ensure that the house of god is maintained . the bible made us to understand that blessed is the hand that giveth . i took this decision because i don ' t have any child that will inherit this money and my husband relatives are not christians and i don ' t want my husband ' s hard earned money to be misused by unbelievers . i don ' t want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly manner , hence the reason for taking this bold decision . i am not afraid of death hence i know where i am going . i know that i am going to be in the bosom of the lord . exodus 14 vs 14 says , ' that the lord will fight my case and i shall hold my peace ' . i don ' t need any telephone communication in this regard because of my health , and because of the presence of my husband ' s relatives around me always . i don ' t want them to know about this development . with god all things are possible . as soon as i receive your reply i shall give you the contact of the finance / security company in europe . i will also issue you a letter of authority through my attorney that will empower you as the original - beneficiary of this fund . i want you and the church to always pray for me because the lord is my shepherd . my happiness is that i lived a life of a worthy christian . whoever that wants to serve the lord must serve him in spirit and truth . please always be prayerful all through your life . any delay in your reply will give me room in sourcing for a church or christian individual for this same purpose . please assure me that you will act accordingly as i stated herein . hoping to hear from and remain blessed in the name of the lord . yours in christ , mrs . esther alan buch . please reply back to this e - mail : : : : estheralanbuch 444 @ hotmail . com",Phishing Email

"zellig harris last thursday night , may 21 , zellig harris died in his sleep after a pleasant working day . he was 88 years old . he was born in 1904 in byelorussia . i am told that he chose the name zellig sabbettai when his family immigrated to the united states when he was four . i like to think that the semantics of happiness and steadfastness were on his mind . certainly they were keynotes of his life . i would guess that his parents chose the name harris . when he died , he was just finishing a book on politics that he had been planning for most of his life . with the 1992 publication of his book _ a theory of language and information _ ( oxford ) , he had wrapped up his life 's work on language , at least for the time being . he seems to have felt at liberty to take up this other unfinished business . i understand from paul mattick , jr . , who was harris 's friend and neighbor for many years in new york , that this last book describes how to get from capitalism to socialism . this is surely not a conventional take on either capitalism or socialism , harris was an anarchist . oxford was interested in publishing it , and he had also talked with cambridge . there is no memorial planned , beyond something very private for his family . however , there is some discussion beginning of a public meeting with scientific content . i would hope that the festschrift that haj ross called for in the lsa meetings some years ago might at last come into being . harris described himself as a methodologist rather than a linguist . this could be misleading . he always said that his work was not part of linguistics as it is institutionally defined , and that linguists would not be interested in his work , though people interested in language would be . nonetheless , he was surely a linguist by most of the operational definitions one might come up with . he had done extensive fieldwork on a variety of language . when he was doing the final revision of the 1992 oxford book , he undertook to test the theory of language against every language of which he had some control , 44 languages . he spent months reading grammars from morning to night , and evaluating whether his theory had a reasonable account for what he found there . he was clear that no scientific conclusions were warranted , and so no particular notice of this check is given in the book , but he wanted to feel reasonably secure that his conclusions were not idiosyncratic to english , french , german , korean , and the few other languages that had been the primary bases for their development . he was pleased with the results . his contributions to the field were numerous and weighty . he founded the first linguistics department in the u . s . he introduced the algebraic representations and abstract mathematical treatment which have become so much norms of the field that it is difficult now to appreciate how much he did so over the kicking and screaming protests of his peers . he invented x - bar notation for immediate constituent analysis , though of course not by that name , to cope with the well known weakness of ic analysis with the head-of relation . he developed ways to accomodate discontinuous morphemes into grammatical analysis . he charted a way out of difficulties experienced by bloch and others in phonology , by saying that contrast rather than phonetic identity is the basis for setting up phonemes , a ghost that has risen to haunt generative phonology more than once . he invented string analysis as a complement ( not rival ) to immediate constituent analysis . their complementarity with respect to the head-of problem is the basis of joshi 's tree - adjoining grammars ( tags ) . he invented transformational analysis in context of developing discourse analysis to get at the information content of texts . other contributions await recognition and exploitation in the field of linguistics as institutionalized today , and in other fields . obvious examples include sublanguage analysis and sublanguage grammar , operator grammar based on word dependency , discourse analysis for information content , and his theory of information as an account of a central aspect of semantics . for example , string grammar and its natural extension into transformational grammar is the basis of the very successful work of naomi sager and others at nyu in information formatting of sublanguage texts , applied there mainly to medical informatics . stephen johnson has implemented a system for representing the information content of texts , based on operator grammar . successes of this sort are little noticed within linguistics . it is characteristic of harris that there was no vanity or self importance in him . he knew that his work was of lasting importance , and treated it as such , but he was no guru or empire builder seeking followers , and would not accept any such role being projected onto him . those students who sought entree to linguistics as a social institution in academia were bound to be disappointed . however , he could scarcely be blamed for their disappointment . he did not provide such entree , nor did he pretend to , and in my hearing actively discouraged students who imagined work with him would further their ambitions in the field . once , in my role as ta for john fought , i prepared a lecture on harris 's approach to syntax and semantics . as we were setting out for the lecture hall , we encountered harris , and i blurted out "" i ' m about to give a lecture on your theory to john 's class . "" ( john , with characteristic wry humor , asked if he wanted to take anything back . ) harris bemusedly questioned whether anyone would be interested in what he was doing . nonetheless , when he gave a public lecture on "" the two structures of language : report and paraphrase "" in 1969 or 1970 , the large auditorium ( i think it was in the furness building ) was filled to capacity , and the critique by john corcoran , published later in the volume _ transformationelle analyse _ edited by senta ploetz , was also well attended . broad attendance on and acclaim for his work could easily have been his , had he chosen it . that is simply not where his ambitions lay . a clue as to the basis of this choice against fame and influence may perhaps be found in his advice to a student starting out in his first teaching position , many years ago . do n't invite anybody over for dinner , he said , and do n't accept any invitations . if you get involved in the social life of an academic , you won't be able to get any work done . the work came first . harris was always an intensely loyal man to his friends and family . the consequences , when combined with his laissez-faire anarchism , were not always happy . his friend and close colleague of many years , henry hiz , was much more concerned with building a formal linguistics program as an institution . the disparity of character could be devastating to students . i studied with harris from 1966 through 1970 . i was an undergraduate much of that time , but that did not matter to him . he had a sink-or - swim approach like that attributed to sapir ( darnell 1990 ) , except that his seminars were of course focussed on theory rather than the data of , say , athabaskan . he would come in to his seminar and just start talking about what he was working on . when i started with him , this was the work that resulted in his 1968 book , _ mathematical structures of language _ ( wiley ) . the process was not a lecture or monologue , but a continuing conversation with his students , trying out alternatives , posing and working out problems for a mathematical characterization of language . after a while , with intensive reading outside , one began to catch on and to participate . i recall telling him at the end of one seminar meeting in my first year that i would try to disprove his theory . this troubled him not a bit . i worked up a problem in modern greek that i thought might be troublesome for his approach . ( i had lived in greece for a couple of years , and spoke the language , but i worked with an informant for this project . ) when my results turned out actually to corroborate the point i had intended to challenge , he merely thanked me for the data on greek . a year or two later , i had come up with a proposal to analyze definitions in a dictionary to extract semantic primitives by a form of componential analysis , much as martha evens and now others have done . although the notion of semantic features seems inimical in concept and method to his work , he said ( and this is an exact quote ) "" others have tried this and have failed , but you are welcome to try . "" i offer this in refutation of the sometimes heard view that harris was dictatorial . i ran into conflicts in such matters with hiz , never with harris . i have also heard it asked why he never retorted to attacks on his work . i think it did not matter to him . he did not expect his methods and results to be understood and taken up by everyone in the field of linguistics . maybe his attitude differed in the 1940s , when he wrote the structural restatements and the manuscript eventually published as _ methods in structural linguistics _ . ( btw , the title was to have said "" descriptive "" but the publisher substituted the buzzword "" structural . "" i recall him saying , amusedly , "" i do n't remember whether they asked me or not . "" ) maybe his expectations of the field changed after some of chomsky 's followers began making him out to be the bad guy . i do n't think so , based on his writings and on the testimony of some who were his students then . i never heard him comment on the commonplace attribution to chomsky of the discovery of transformational grammar and the "" transformational revolution . "" there is a passage in _ the state of the art _ ( 1968 ) in which hockett attributes to harris "" nothing , or a long silence , after 1957 , "" showing ignorance not only of things like string analysis , for which he might be excused , but even ignoring the 1965 paper transformational theory prominently published in _ language _ . i showed this passage to harris , and he shrugged . it did not matter . in particular , i never saw any evidence that harris opposed or blocked chomsky 's ambitions . in my experience it would have been entirely out of character for him . for example , it was harris who proposed chomsky to speak in his stead to the 1962 international congress . a similar canard regarding bernard bloch has recently been laid to rest in an editorial in language . one must i think be alert to the social psychology that leads some people to rewrite history so that their avatar is depicted as an embattled hero . now , an old indian friend once told me that one cannot point a finger without having three other fingers of the same hand pointing back , so i hasten to add that this is not the picture i intend to paint here of harris . he accomplished what he intended to quite well , thank you very much , and seems to have been quite happy in the process . the point is precisely that he seemed in no way embattled by attacks and uncomprehending misconstruals of his work . and uncomprehending misconstruals abound . frawley 's review of _ a grammar of english on mathematical principles _ ( gemp ) is a good example . he identifies harris 's operator grammar with predicate calculus , though harris is at pains to delineate critical differences between language ( a fortiori operator grammar ) and language-like mathematical systems , including predicate calculus . frawley can see in this comprehensive grammar only an attempt to do 1960s generative grammar in 1980 , because he is unable to step out of the generativist paradigm so as to understand harris 's work on its own terms . another review ( eric wheeler , 1984 in _ computers in the humanities _ ) asserted that harris 's grammar was unable to account for certain familiar semantic problems - - middle voice , the semantics of find vs . seek , and quantifier scope in examples like "" someone was opposed by everyone . "" in my review ( _ computational linguistics _ in 1984 ) i showed how harris did in fact account of each of these problems in the book . michael kac , in his review of harris 's selected writings , asked "" why bother ? "" and indeed , from within the generativist paradigm that must be the only plausible question . it is only in setting aside paradigmatic blinkers that one can see , having these writings in one place , how consistent and self coherent harris 's program has been over the years . transformational grammar was not a revolutionary break but part of a continuous evolution . i will mention only one other misconception about harris 's work , not because it is in any way fundamental but because it is so commonplace . i probably will be greeted with disbelief when i say that discovery procedures were not his aim . ( jim mccawley 's witticism about harris and discovery procedures in the collection traditionally circulated in may really reverses the roles of the teller and the butt of the joke . ) it is not hard to see how linguists have come to this mistaken belief . discovery procedures are an abiding fixture for linguistics as institutionally defined . when _ methods _ was published , linguists sought an aid to fieldwork and writing of linguistic descriptions . now , discovery procedures are institutionalized as a whipping boy . this has colored perceptions of harris 's intentions and results . for harris , it was certainly of interest and value when redundancy on one level of linguistic representation could be used in a practical way to determine boundaries of objects on the next , but this was a corroborative byproduct , not an aim . the "" constructional procedure "" described in the 1955 paper from phoneme to morpheme was implemented in fortran in the early 1960s and proven to work , and ralph grishman has had some preliminary success in implementing programs to discover word classes and rules of sublanguage grammar from sublanguage texts . but in general harris did not think that discovery procedures were feasible . in particular , he told me he thought that grammatical analysis could not be done solely with a corpus or by asking informants , one had to control the language oneself . and then one had to work over the data to tease out pattern and wrestle it into coherent form , a lengthy and demanding process , as probably most of us know from experience . so much for the popularized image of feeding in a corpus , turning a crank , and having a grammar reel out the other end . in the introduction to _ methods in structural linguistics _ , harris states clearly that these methods are not discovery procedures . he accepts that one uses many means to come up with proposals for describing what is going on in a language - - hunches , guesses , heuristic rules of thumb , typological generalizations , proposed universals , comparison with related languages or earlier stages of the language , and so on , more art than science ( or rather , more art than engineering ) . harris was acutely aware of the danger of swamping one 's control of the language by growing familiarity with marginal examples . language is after all a social institution , continuously in change as it is constantly recreated in the crucible of use . the aim of the methods was not to substitute for these informal ways of coming up with possible analyses , but to verify , for any given result , whether the result had a valid relation to the data of the language . of those who have actually read the book , how many have said ( and some have in fact said to me ) "" he did n't really mean that . "" but if nothing else , harris was always careful to say exactly what he meant . this concern for verification arises out of a deeper concern which becomes more explicit in harris 's later work . this is a critical point for linguistics . for any other science , there is a standpoint external to the science domain for its metascience . in particular , practitioners in physics , chemistry , even in mathematics , rely on the "" background vernacular "" of language to ensure communication about shared meanings and ultimately to validate the relation of conclusions , however reached , to the observations on which they are based . not so for a science of language . harris recognized and accepted that there is no vantage point outside of language from which to describe language . and , observably , each language contains its own metalanguage . i ' ll repeat that , because it is i think a key to understanding what harris was about , and because it is easy to overlook its importance . there is no vantage point outside of language from which to describe language . by contrast , generativist theory postulates a universal metalanguage , external to language , that is part of one 's biological endowment . ( i personally do not find this biologicist , neophrenologist doctrine of mental organs credible , but the issue rests not on opinion but on facts yet to be determined . ) this stance seems to me perfectly consonant with the argument made by stephen anderson in "" why phonology is n't natural . "" one cannot derive linguistic structure from the findings of some study bearing a metascience relation to linguistics . harris was interested in how language can carry or transmit information , and this is the thread that underlies the really remarkable consistency in his work over more than 50 years . intuitively , we know that differences in form correlate with differences in meaning , but the correlation is messy and inconsistent in the observed data of language ( say , in a body of writings or of phonemic transcriptions , including whatever utterances the investigator may come up with in the ad hoc search for examples ) . what harris found was how this messy , inconsistent stream of words can be the product of two concurrent systems : a system of word dependencies that correlates with perceptions in a subject-matter domain such as a science subfield , and a system of reductions that changes word shapes ( often to zero ) , motivated in part by issues of redundancy and efficiency and in part by historically contingent social convention . the reductions introduce degeneracies such as ambiguity and paraphrase , and otherwise obscure the correlation of form with meaning , but without destroying that correlation . given that structure ( differences of form ) correlates with meaning , it is of critical importance that the machinery of description not import any structure extraneous to that found in language . harris 's endeavor was always , then , to determine a "" least grammar , "" a description that required an absolute minimum of primitive objects and relations . any additional objects or relations in the description introduce extrinsic structure that obscures the informational structure in language . this could be the basis for a telling critique of various other theories of language . harris chose not to make such a critique . when i asked him once about certain aspects of generativist theory , he would only comment , with evidence of mild amusement , that it did seem to be over-structured . like his teacher , sapir , harris had an interest in problems of international communication and an international auxiliary language . ( a paper on this appeared in a 1962 volume on avoiding world war iii . remember wwiii , everyone ? ) and like sapir and bloomfield he had in particular a long standing interest in international cooperation and communication in science . this culminated in _ the form of information in science : analysis of an immunology sublanguage _ ( with michael gottfried , tom ryckman , and others , 1989 , john benjamins ) . this book describes the grammar of the sublanguage of immunology during a specific period in the development of that field , based on discourse analysis of sublanguage texts from that period and adequate for making explicit the information structures in arbitrary other texts in that sublanguage . the analysis shows how the structure of the sublanguage changed concurrently with a change in immunologists ' perceptions in the domain of their science . a difference in informational structure correlates with a difference in meaning . the informational structures that are clearly represented in the binary array resulting from discourse analysis are still present in the actual form of the source texts as written albeit obscured under reductions in word shape , some motivated by considerations of informational efficiency and avoidance of redundancy , some dictated by conventions of language use as a human social institution . harris arranged his life so as to enhance the autonomy of his work . i understand that his kibbutz in israel is a wealthy one , to which members give their assets and income , and which in turn supports them in their needs . i believe that the kibbutz purchased his apartment building on charles street . until his retirement , he held an endowed chair at penn , the benjamin franklin professorship in linguistics . he was principal investigator for a long series of grants from the nsf , nimh , and other agencies whose committees and referees found his work of continuing value . throughout his life he was involved with scientists and science . his wife was a physicist at the university of jerusalem , and had been albert einstein 's assistant at princeton . a brother was an immunologist ( he is an author of some of the work analyzed in the 1989 book ) . he felt that the rough and tumble of polemic attack and retort was inappropriate for science , and would not participate in it . that too would be a distraction from the work . after one of the bampton lectures at columbia in 1986 , a young member of the audience approached him and asked what he would take up if he had another lifetime before him . he mentioned poetry , especially the longer works of 19th century poets like browning . he mentioned music . and he mentioned sign language . he had a long and very productive life . he had brought his life 's work to a successful culmination . with the completion of his book on politics , i imagine death coming to him , as to the chess playing knight in the seventh seal , and him saying "" ok , i ' m ready now . "" it was a privilege to know him and to learn from him . he is an abiding inspiration . bruce nevin bn @ bbn . com",Safe Email

day workshop on interactions in virtual reality ( vr ) environments . anyone dealing with theoretical , empirical , computational , experimental , sociological and anthropological aspects of vr environments that are either purely artificial or use real world characteristics is invited to participate in this workshop . in this workshop the emphasis is on vr environments that provide means for interacting with the objects in the environment , with embedded information sources and services ( possibly represented as agents ) or with other users and visitors of the environment . motivation in recent years we have seen that the computer science and the cognitive ergonomics communities have discovered and are exploring the possibilities of vr in user interfaces . in order to visualize available information and to provide users access to this information , virtual environments have been built such that users can find and explore information , communicate with other users and can communicate with objects and agents in the virtual worlds . this workshop emphasizes the role of vr in interfaces and in environments in which people share knowledge and experience and in which new forms of interactivity will emerge . in particular we want to explore the role of speech and language in virtual environments . how can we navigate in vr using speech and language , how can we model multimodal access to such environments , how can we communicate with other humans and with artificial agents in the vr environment , etc . the workshop is organized in the context of the u - wish project of the dutch telematics institute . format the format of the workshop will consist of keynote presentations by experts in the fields of vr , dialogue modelling and speech and language processing , combined with presentations of accepted papers . all presentations will be plenary . submission procedure researchers working in this domain are invited to email a 400 -

Date: Not suppliedThis is the headline of the month, possibly the year: ""Doctors Grow Pig Teeth 
in Rat Intestines."" Do we even need to read the story to understand it? It's 
like a freaking _haiku_ of near-singularity, future-shocky wonderment!     U.S. doctors said on Thursday they have managed to grow living pig teeth in 
    rats, a feat of biotechnology that experts said could spark a dental 
    revolution.     Researchers at Boston's Forsyth Institute said their successful experiment 
    suggests the existence of dental stem cells, which could one day allow a 
    person to replace a lost tooth with an identical one grown from his or her 
    own cells.     ""The ability to identify, isolate and propagate dental stem cells to use in 
    biological replacement tooth therapy has the potential to revolutionize 
    dentistry,"" said Dominick DePaola, president and CEO of the institute that 
    focuses on oral and facial science.  Link[1] Discuss[2] (_Thanks, Dave[3]!_)[1] http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&ncid=585&e=1&cid=585&u=/nm/20020926/sc_nm/health_teeth_dc

[ Messages on the IEDR-FORUM list at the time don't support 
  your assertion ]As an aside, shortly after my note on Friday uucp-gw-1.pa.dec.com and
uucp-gw-2.pa.dec.com stopped responding to DNS requests. So IE had
two dead nameservers, four stuck a week in the past and three
working correctly. Marvellous.

1. Use of $Config is gradually being removed, thankfully.  I don't want
to see any of that stuff in there if it acn be avoided, as different
perl versions jsut vary so much in that stuff.2. perl has no concept of where the rules could be -- unless they're in
the perl libdir (/usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.x.x/foo).  Perl does not
know about the existence of /usr/share or /etc.  Used to use /usr/lib/perl5
for storing rules, and it was actually *much worse* than it is now. So
we need an out-of-band way to tell SA where to find this stuff. that's
the problem!3. try ""perl Makefile.PL < /dev/null"" to allow bots to build it.I think I might be missing some details of what you're peeved about,
though... could you elaborate specifically?

"project qin wang lloyds tsb pacific limited hong kong branch fax : + 852 - 301 - 66259 thank you for giving me your time . please be patient and read my email to you . i am a staff of lloyds tsb group attached in private banking services . i am contacting you concerning a customer and , an investment placed under our banks management 3 years ago , i contacted you independently of our investigation and no one is informed of this communication and i would like to intimate you with certain facts that i believe would be of interest to you . in 2000 , the subject matter ; ref : bb / tsb / bank / 73 came to our bank to engage in business discussions with our private banking services department . he informed us that he had a financial portfolio of 8 . 35 million united states dollars , which he wished to have us turn over on his behalf . i was the officer assigned to his case ; i made numerous suggestions in line with my duties as the de - facto chief operations officer of the private banking services department , especially given the volume of funds he wished to put into our bank . we met on numerous occasions prior to any investments being placed . i encouraged him to consider various growth funds with prime ratings . the favored route in my advice to customers is to start by assessing data on 600 traditional stocks and bond managers and alternative investments . based on my advice , we spun the money around various opportunities and made attractive margins for our first months of operation , the accrued profit and interest stood at this point at over 10 million united states dollars , this margin was not the full potential of the fund but he desired low risk guaranteed returns on investments . in mid 2001 , he asked that the money be liquidated because he needed to make an urgent investment requiring cash payments in europe . he directed that i liquidate the funds and had it deposited with a firm in europe . i informed him that our bank would have to make special arrangements to have this done and in order not to circumvent due process , the bank would have to make a 9 . 5 % deduction from the funds to cater for banking and statutory charges . he complained about the charges but later came around when i explained to him the complexities of the task he was asking of us . cash movement across borders has become especially strict since the incidents of 9 / 11 . i contacted my affiliate in europe and had the funds available in main land europe . i undertook all the processes and made sure i followed his precise instructions to the letter and had the funds deposited in a security consultancy firm , the firm is a specialist private firm that accepts deposits from high net worth individuals and blue chip corporations that handle valuable products or undertake transactions that need immediate access to cash . this small and highly private organization is familiar especially to the highly placed and well - connected organizations . in line with instructions , the money was deposited . he told me he wanted the money there in anticipation of his arrival from norway later that week . this was the last communication we had , this transpired around 20 th june 2002 . in june last year , we got a call from the security firm informing us of the inactivity of that particular portfolio . this was an astounding position as far as i was concerned , given the fact that i managed the private banking sector i was the only one who knew about the deposit , and i could not understand why he had not come forward to claim his deposit . i made futile efforts to locate him i immediately passed the task of locating him to the internal investigations department of our bank . four days later , information started to trickle in , that he was apparently dead . a person who suited his description was declared dead of a heart attack in cannes , south of france . we were soon enough able to identify the body and cause of death was confirmed . the bank immediately launched an investigation into possible surviving next of kin to alert about the situation and also to come forward to claim his estate . if you are familiar with private banking affairs , those who patronize our services usually prefer anonymity , but also some levels of detachment from conventional processes . in his bio - data form , he listed no next of kin . in the field of private banking , opening an account with us means no one will know of its existence , accounts are rarely held under a name depositors use numbers and codes to make the accounts anonymous . this bank also gives the choice to depositors of having their mail sent to them or held at the bank itself , ensuring that there are no traces of the account and as i said , rarely do they nominate next of kin . private banking clients apart from not nominating next of kin also usually in most cases leave wills in our care , in this case ; he died in testate . what i wish to relate to you will smack of unethical practice but i want you to understand something . it is only an outsider to the banking world who finds the internal politics of the banking world aberrational . the world of private banking especially is fraught with huge rewards for those who occupy certain offices and oversee certain portfolios . you should have begun by now to put together the general direction of what i propose . there is us $ 8 , 370 , 000 . 00 deposited , i alone have the deposit details and they will release the deposit to no one unless i instruct them to do so . i alone know of the existence of this deposit for as far as the finance firm , the transaction with our deceased customer concluded when i sent the funds to the firm , all outstanding interactions in relation to the file are just customer services and due process . the finance firm has no single idea of what ' s the history or nature of the deposit . they are simply awaiting instructions to release the deposit to any party that comes forward . this is the situation . this bank has spent great amounts of money trying to track this man ' s family ; they have investigated for months and have found no family . the investigation has come to an end . my proposal , you share similar details to the late fellow i am prepared to place you in a position to instruct the finance firm to release the deposit to you as the closest surviving relation . upon receipt of the deposit , i am prepared to share the money with you in half and no more . that is : i will simply nominate you as the next of kin and have them release the deposit to you . we share the proceeds 50 / 50 . i would have gone ahead to ask the funds be released to me , but that would have drawn a straight line to me and my involvement in claiming the deposit . but on the other hand , you with a similar name as the original depositor would easily pass as the beneficiary with the rights to claim . i assure you that i could have the deposit released to you in a few days . i will simply inform our bank of the final closing of the file relating to the customer . i will then officially communicate with the finance company and instruct them to release the deposit to you . with these two things : all is done . the alternative would be for us to have the firm direct the funds to another bank with you as accountholder . this way there will be no need for you to think of receiving the money from the firm . we can fine - tune this based on our interactions . i am aware of the consequences of this proposal . i ask that if you find no interest in this project that you should discard this mail . i ask that you do not be vindictive or destructive . if my offer is of no appeal to you , delete this message and forget i ever contacted you . do not destroy my career because you do not approve of my proposal . you may not know this but people like myself who have made tidy sums out of comparable situations run the whole private banking sector . i am not a criminal and what i do , i do not find against good conscience , this may be hard for you to understand , but the dynamics of my industry dictates that i make this move . such opportunities only come ones ' way once in a lifetime . i cannot let this chance pass me by i hope you understand because for once i found myself in total control and face to face with my destiny . these chances won ' t pass me by . i ask that you do not destroy my chance , if you will not work with me let me know and let me move on with my life but do not destroy me . i am a family man and this is an opportunity to provide them with new opportunities . there is a reward for this project and it is a task well worth undertaking . i have evaluated the risks and the only risk i have here is from you refusing to work with me and alerting my bank . i am the only one who knows of this situation , good fortune has blessed you with a name that has planted you into the center of relevance in my life . let ' s share the blessing . if you give me positive signals , i will initiate this process towards a conclusion . i wish to inform you that should you contact me via official channels ; i will deny knowing you and about this project . i repeat , i do not want you contacting me through my official phone lines nor do i want you contacting me through my official email account . contact me only through this email address ( q _ wang @ o 2 . pl ) i do not want any direct link between you and me . my official lines are not secure lines as they are periodically monitored to assess our level of customer care in line with our total quality management policy . please observe this instruction religiously . please , again , note i am a family man ; i happily married with two kids . i send you this mail not without a measure of fear as to what the consequences might be , but i know within me that nothing ventured is nothing gained and that success and riches never come easy or on a platter of gold . this is the one truth i have learned from my private banking clients . do not betray my confidence . if we can be of one accord , we should plan a meeting , soon . i await your response . sincerely , qin wang * este mensaje fue enviado desde http : / / www . enterate . com . ar / * conectate gratis a internet desde enterate ! usuario : enterate @ enterate . com . ar clave : enterate desde buenos aires : 4004 - 8007 desde otras ciudades , consulta en :",Phishing Email

 It's August, and big cats are on the prowl
 By Alan Hamilton
 
 
 
 ROUND up the sheep. Pull on the gauntlets. Oil the shotgun. The British
 countryside is crawling with pumas, black panthers, fen tigers and other big,
 vicious cats. No corner of the nation is safe. Evidence released yesterday,
 including sightings, photographs, paw prints, livestock kills and hair
 samples, claims to prove that every county has big cats lurking in its
 undergrowth, poised to pounce on man and beast alike. 
 
 Sightings have reached record levels in 2002, according to Daniel Bamping,
 founder of the British Big Cats Society, which in the past 12 months has
 received more than 800 reports of big cat sightings. 
 
 Â“During the first six months we have seen an incredible amount of big cat
 activity. We have now had reports in every single county; the response from
 the public has been fantastic,Â” Mr Bamping said. Â“Big cats in Britain are
 real. They are out there, they are breeding; thereÂ’s more of them.Â” 
 
 Scotland and Gloucestershire are said to be hotspots of big cat activity. Mark
 Fraser, who heads the societyÂ’s Scottish arm, said: Â“Lynx are now present in
 the Scottish countryside; I believe they are established and breeding. I donÂ’t
 want to hazard a guess at the numbers; suffice it to say there are several
 hotspots, notably Fife, Aberdeenshire, Inverness and the Borders.Â” 
 
 Next month the society plans to unveil its full dossier of evidence, which
 includes two dead wild cats, pictures of paw prints and tree scratchings, as
 well as stories of a horse strangely lacerated in West Wales and a man in
 Gravesham, Kent, who had to beat a hasty retreat to his garage after his hand
 was cut by a creature the size of a labrador dog, except that it had black
 hairy tufts on the tips of its ears. 
 
 The society is taking the sightings seriously. It plans to set up a network of
 trigger-cameras throughout the country to capture further evidence of the
 beasts, which it will then present to the Government. 
 
 It is not, however, clear on what it wants the Government to do about it all.
 Throwing its weight behind the pro-hunting lobby might be a start. 
 
 Next in August: record abductions by aliens.

Errrr....the biz guys in my office don't care what the ""WISPs"" want to do
with their little WiFi networks.  And the bandwidth shadows in most cities
are surprisingly large and common.  They aren't selling the software, which
is pretty pricy as it happens.  They are using it to optimize next
generation wireless canopies over metro areas and fiber networks on a large
scale.  There are an essentially infinite number of metro wireless
configurations, some of which generate far more dead or marginal spots and
others which are very expensive to operate (due to backhaul transit
considerations) or both.  This software can be used as a tool to optimize
the canopy coverage and minimize the actual transit costs since the wireless
is tied into fiber at multiple points.The canopies we are talking about aren't short-range wifi technologies, but
a mixture of long-range high-performance wireless networking, with bandwidth
measured in tens to hundreds of mbits and ranges measured in miles (up to
well over a hundred miles on the extreme end).  At those ranges and
bandwidth levels, the cost of providing the network can easily vary by an
order of magnitude or more depending on how you manage RF shadows and
proximity to fiber access points.  The idea ultimately is to optimize the
cost and performance such that no existing network infrastructure providers
can remotely compete and maintain profitability.  This is a surprisingly low
bar, and it is about time networks were designed with this level of
large-scale optimization (cost per mbit, maximizing coverage, and effective
bandwidth available per unit area) in any case.  And for this company's
long-term plans, this type of capability will be absolutely necessary to
keep things sane.Or at least investors find this capability very sexy and compelling,
especially since we have this lovely visualization engine tied into the
system (CLI batches never have the same effect, even if it is more
efficient).-James Rogers

________________________________________________
END OF LIST OF FIVE NAMES*********************Step 2.  These Guides will be emailed to you.  Save these
Guides on your computer's hard disk as other people will be
ordering these Guides from you, paying you for them and
you will need to email the Guides to the new buyers.Step 3.  From the list of names above, delete the name and
address of the person shown under GUIDE#5, and replace that
slot with the name and address of the person from GUIDE #4's
slot.  Be sure to copy the name and address exactly as shown.
Check the address again.Step 4.  Delete name and address under GUIDE #4, and
replace with the name and address from GUIDE #3's slot.Step 5.  Delete name and address under GUIDE #3, and
replace with the name and address from  GUIDE#2's slot.Step 6.  Delete name and address under GUIDE #2, and
replace with the name and address from GUIDE #1's slot.Step 7.  Delete name and address under GUIDE #1, and
replace with YOUR OWN NAME AND ADDRESS. This
step is how your own name and address is entered into the
list of names to receive orders for the Guides. Eventually,
your own name will go down the list of names until you have
reached GUIDE #5, and then be dropped from the list. The
key point is that the number of people ordering Guides from
you will grow larger the lower down the list your name goes.Step 8.  Once you have completed this new list, send out
this new email (which shows your name under GUIDE #1) to
as many email addresses as possible, as many as 100,000
emails or even more.  The greater the number of mailings
you make, potentially the greater the number of people who
will order the GUIDE #1 from you.  These people will then
make new emails to send out to their addresses with the email
showing your name under GUIDE #2, and so on.This is all you need to do.  If you wish to read the rest of
this email message, then do so.  If not, just do the 8 steps
shown above. Remember, the key point is to send out as
many emails as possible in step 8, and to encourage and help
those who purchase the Guides from you to send out
emails of their own.Do NOT change anything other than what is instructed.
Because if you do, it will not work for you.  Your immediate
reaction might be: Why not replace all the names on the list
with the names of your spouse, kids, relatives, and friends.
That might seem to you like a clever move because new
buyers will be sending their money to these people.  But
that move is the exact opposite of what is to your benefit.
What will benefit you most is having people who will send
out emails, seek new buyers, and provide assistance to new
buyers. If the people you slip into that list aren't going to
be sending new emails, you're only hurting yourself by
effectively closing down the program with your name on
top of the list of the names that you have inserted.  There
wouldn't be new buyers coming in. So, your sly maneuver
will gain you exactly zero!  Furthermore, if you have done
the work, and your name has worked its way to further
down the list, by then you deserve the rewards and
earnings from that effort, and it would be unethical for
anyone to remove your name for whatever reason.  Don't
do it to others. Remember, honesty reaps the reward!!!You may have a concern that after sending the total $50 to
the five people on the list that one of the people will just
take your money, and not send you the Guide.  Well, rest
assured.  As we said above, it's to our benefit to have you
as a satisfied buyer who will actively send out emails to find
new buyers.  So don't think the people on the list will try to
cheat you or to ""stiff"" you for $10.00.  The people on the list
would rather have you working hard because your effort will
benefit them as well as you.  Later on, when other buyers send
you the order to buy the Guides, fulfill your end of the deal
by sending the ordered Guide to the buyer.  Don't cheat.
Provide efficient and honest service and we will all benefit.
******END OF SUMMARY************************=======REST OF MESSAGE======================With easy-to-use email tools and opt-in email, success in
this business is now well within the capabilities of ordinary
people who may not have done any internet marketing before.
And the earnings potential is staggering!READ THIS EMAIL TO THE END! -
follow what it says  - and you will not worry whether a
RECESSION is coming or not, or whether or not you can
afford to buy that new car or home that you have been
looking for.  Yes, I know what you are thinking. I never
responded to one of these before either. One day though,
something made me feel: ""You use $50 going to a movie
for 2 hours with your spouse, friend, or child, plus a simple
meat at a restaurant.  Why the heck not?""  No matter where
you believe those ""feelings"" came from, I thank every day
that feeling came over me.I cannot imagine where I would be or what I would be doing
had I not. Read on. It works.  And when you read the Guides,
YouÂ’ll learn how to become a more effective communicator.
What can be better?  A way to improve your self-image and
confidence and at the same time have the potential to recover
your investment and make some good money: making over
half a million dollars every 4 to 5 months from your home.
If you work on this program, you will learn a lot about direct
marketing on the internet.  If you believe direct marketing
via the internet is the way sales and marketing will be done
in the future, then the experience you will gain here could
be a real boost in your work career, possibly even providing
a new career for you.= PRINT THIS MESSAGE FOR FUTURE REFERENCE =If you want to make serious money, read this message until
you understand it completely and feel confident to follow
through on what it advises.FOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTION ABOVE AND
YOUR FINANCIAL DREAMS CAN COME TRUE!Remember, this method has been tested, and if you alter it,
it will NOT work!  This IS a legitimate BUSINESS. You
are offering a product for sale to a buyer. Treat it as such
and you can see money coming to you  in a reasonable period
of time, depending on the collective efforts of yourself and
the others on the list of five.===========================================
*** Take this entire email, with the modified list of names,
and save it on your computer. DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER
CHANGES.  There are 2 methods to get this venture going:METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK EMAIL LEGALLY
===========================================Let's say that you start small, to see how it goes, and that
you and those involved send out only 5,000 emails each.
Let's also assume that the mailing receives only a 0.1%
(1/10 of 1%) response (the response could be much better
but let's just say it is only 0.1%). Also many people will
send out hundreds of thousands of emails instead of only
5,000 each.Out of your 5,000 emails and a 0.1% response, that is only
5 orders for Guide # 1. Those 5 people who responded also
send out 5,000 emails each for a total of 25,000. Out of
those 25,000 emails only 0.1% responded with orders.
That's 25 people who responded and ordered Guide # 2.Those 25 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of
125,000 emails. The 0.1% response to that is 125 orders
for Guide # 3. Those 125 people send 5,000 emails each
for a total of 625,000 emails sent out. The 0.1% response
is 625 orders for Guide # 4.Those 625 people send out 5,000 emails each for a total
of 3,125,000 emails. The 0.1% response to that is  3,125
orders for Guide # 5, or $31,250 at $10 per Guide.  This
may seem a small amount to you, but remember we used a
very low response rate with a small number of emails being
sent out.  See what happens if you can get the response rate
up just slightly.If Response Rate is 0.1%, income from Guides #1 - #5 is:
$50+250+1,250+6,250+31,250 = $39,050 (as above)If Response Rate is 0.15%, income from Guides #1 - #5 is:
$75+560+4,220+31,640+237,300 = $273,795If Response Rate is 0.2%, income from Guides #1 - #5 is:
$100+1,000+10,000+100,000+1,000,000 = $1,111,100Dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone
or half or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000
emails each or more?  From the example above, you can see
the power of leveraging, that is, how much greater is the
amount of money from a small increase in the response rate.There are over 200 million people on the internet worldwide
and counting, with thousands more coming online every day.METHOD # 2: PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET
===========================================Advertising on the net is very, very inexpensive and there are
Many FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on
the internet will get a response. We strongly suggest you start
with  Method # 1 and add METHOD # 2 as you go along.
For every $10 you receive, all you must do is email the
Guide the buyer ordered. Always provide same day service.The people you buy these Guides from will assist and advise
you how to get the large number of email addresses that
you need to send the new email containing your name and
address.  In return, when others buy the Guides from you,
you also should help those buyers to resell the Guides to
their email addresses.  This will benefit you because your
name would be further down the list, and their new buyers
will buy from you.  This is no different than ""customer
service"" in the retail or the  ""bricks and mortars"" business.===========AVAILABLE GUIDES ==============
The reason for the ""cash"" is not because this is illegal or
somehow  ""wrong"". It is simply about time. Time for checks
or credit cards to be cleared or approved, etc. Concealing it
is simply so no one can SEE there is money in the envelope
and steal it before it gets to you.ORDER EACH GUIDE BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY.
Always send a single $10 bill (U.S. CURRENCY) for each
Guide.  Checks NOT accepted. Make sure the cash is hidden
by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper. On one of
those sheets of paper, write the NUMBER & the NAME
of the Guide you are ordering, YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS
and your name and postal address.  Be sure to address the
envelope correctly and put the proper amount of stamps to
mail the envelope.PLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE GUIDES NOW
FROM THE NAME AND ADDRESS LIST SHOWN
AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS EMAIL
________________________________________________

"workshop on dialogue and prosody call for papers you are invited to submit an abstract plus title to the esca tutorial and research workshop on dialogue and prosody eindhoven ( the netherlands ) , september 1 - 3 , 1999 http : / / www . tue . nl / ipo / sli / etrw . html introduction the ipo , center for research on user - system interaction in eindhoven ( the netherlands ) , in association with the eindhoven university of technology ( tue ) and the european speech communication association ( esca ) , is pleased to announce a 3 - day workshop on dialogue and prosody , which will take place in the eindhoven area in the week before eurospeech ` 99 . anyone dealing with theoretical , empirical , computational or experimental approaches to the interplay between dialogue and prosody is invited to submit an abstract . we specifically welcome those contributions of which the content is directly relevant for human-computer interaction . motivation now that spoken dialogue systems are becoming more sophisticated , increasing demands are placed on the way these systems deal with prosody , both in the generation of system utterances as in the processing of user utterances . on the one hand , appropriate prosody may facilitate the processing of system utterances by users of a dialogue system . on the other hand , dialogue systems may profit from taking into consideration prosodic information of user utterances at different levels of representation . however , for experts in the area of prosody it is not always easy to link their work to the developments in the domain of dialogue modelling , whereas researchers working in the area of dialogue modelling often are rather naive with respect to prosodic modelling . the goal of the workshop is bringing together researchers from both domains to provide either group with a better view of developments in the other domain and in this way stimulate progress . format the format of the workshop will consist of keynote presentations by experts in the field of dialogue and prosody modelling , combined with oral and poster presentations of accepted papers . all presentations will be plenary . all contributions to the workshop will be published in workshop proceedings , that will consist of 4 - page camera-ready papers . as an additional result of the workshop , the organizers intend to produce a working document that will contain an overview of the state-of - the-art , some open research questions , and position statements regarding the theme of dialogue and prosody . in order to maximize the possibilities for fruitful discussion , the number of participants will be limited to about a hundred . priority wil be given to persons with accepted papers on a first-come first-served basis . topics questions in this domain that could be addressed at the workshop are for instance : - which prosodic features of user utterances help the system to improve performance with respect to asr , speech understanding , and dialogue management ( turn-taking , back-channeling ) ? - how can those features be extracted automatically and be made available at the right time ? - with which prosodic features should system utterances be provided to help the user extract the information conveyed by the system , and to improve the fluency of the interaction ? - to what extent are prosodic characteristics of user utterances in their interactions with dialogue systems different from those in human-human interaction ? - how do we deal with prosodic variability in interactions between humans and machines , for instance due to level of expertise ( novices versus experts ) ? submission procedure researchers working in this domain are invited to email a 400 - words abstract ( plain ascii format ) , together with title , affiliation and keywords to diapro @ ipo . tue . nl if electronic submission is not possible , please send 5 copies of a 1 - page abstract to ipo , center for research on user - system interaction etrw on dialogue and prosody p . o . box 513 nl-5600 mb eindhoven ( the netherlands ) scientific committee gosta bruce ( sweden ) nick campbell ( japan ) carlos gussenhoven ( the netherlands ) julia hirschberg ( usa ) daniel hirst ( france ) merle horne ( sweden ) jill house ( uk ) stephen isard ( uk ) johanna moore ( uk ) elmar noeth ( germany ) anton nijholt ( the netherlands ) mari ostendorf ( usa ) thomas portele ( germany ) stephen pulman ( uk ) angelien sanderman ( the netherlands ) elizabeth shriberg ( usa ) david traum ( usa ) gert veldhuijzen van zanten ( the netherlands ) marilyn walker ( usa ) venue the etrw on dialogue and prosody will take place in the koningshof conference center , which is located in a rural setting in veldhoven , at close distance from eindhoven ( www . koningshof . nl ) . important dates january 15 , 1999 : deadline for submission of title and abstract march 1 , 1999 : notification of acceptance , instruction for authors , information on accommodation july 1 , 1999 : deadline for 4 - page camerady-ready paper , early registration september 1 - 3 , 1999 : etrw on dialogue and prosody further information for further information , please contact marc swerts ( swerts @ ipo . tue . nl ) or jacques terken ( terken @ ipo . tue . nl ) . updated information will also be available at http : / / www . tue . nl / ipo / sli / etrw . html",Safe Email

point of the earlier 3-person example. But OK, Mr Math, let it be N men and women, for any N>2. They 
all pair off. Then, some number H, N>H>0, of men has sex with 
all the other N-1 women he hasn't yet had sex with. Pick any N and H that might be interesting. Any choice of
values results in meaningful differences between the sexes' 
""promiscuity"", as commonly understood. It should be more 
obvious with extreme choices of numbers, but it is also true 
for any choice of N and H, if unrealistic totals distract you.Further, and I was hoping this would be clear without saying
so outright, this model actually approximates the cliche 
""common wisdom"" about per-gender sexual behavior, if you 
reverse the male and female roles.Those stereotypes are: that more men than women seek multiple
partners -- men being ""more promiscuous"" than women -- and that 
surplus of male interest is satisfied by a smaller number of 
hyperpromiscuous women (often derisively labelled ""sluts"").> So I chose not to type ""on average"" explicitly in my post, since this

# Well, DUH!!!
# 
# It is perfectly obvious that (heterosexual) promiscuity is exactly,
# precisely identical between males and females.
# 
# Of course the shapes of the distributions may differ.If you assumed people on FoRK had a clue, would you have needed
to jump in with a patronizing ""DUH!!""? If you were talking about fuzzy, typical behavior, would you have 
huffed and puffed with the words ""perfectly obvious"" and ""exactly, 
precisely identical""? If your concern was with the ""typical"", why didn't you adopt the 
typical definition of ""promiscuous"", rather than a straw-man
definition which allowed you to interject ""DUH!!"" and mock an
anthrolopology professor's conclusions? > Actually, you probably just

itself sloppy and erroneous, then others may get a kick out of

( note that this is 3 days after their authority expires ) ferc will release its proposed order on 11 / 1 / 2000 based on the results of its 206 investigation of the california wholesale power markets . we don ' t know what they will find or what they will propose . the proposed order will have a 30 day comment period , after which ferc will likely issue a final order . ferc will be accepting oral comments on 11 / 9 / 2000 in washington . enron still has to determine who will provide oral comments . many companies have filed at ferc advocating or opposing a litany of price caps , cost based rates , and market redesign recommendations . it is likely that the price caps approved by the iso board will go into effect . how long they will remain in effect will depend on whether ferc extends the iso price cap authority and whether the final order stemming from the current 206 investigation stipulates a specific price cap policy . impact of price caps the attached spreadsheet contains a table of likely maximum monthly prices at different gas price levels . we think that this is the highest that markets would clear since it assumes that each hour clears at the cap . it is hard to say whether actual prices would clear significantly lower than the cap because we don ' t know whether sellers will offer below the cap or at the cap . the assumptions behind our analysis are detailed in the bullets below . take actual historical loads from 1999 and 2000 . calculate implied price cap for each hour using actual historical load , new price cap methodology , and a range of gas prices . divide historical hours into peak and off - peak buckets . calculate average price for each month for peak hours and off - peak hours . for example , we have two years worth of data for the months of january through september . each month has approximately 400 hours . for january through september , we took approximately 800 observations for each month ( 400 from each year ) and calculated a simple average of all of the individual observations . we created a peak table and an off - peak table . the table shows the calculated implied cap based off of the acutal loads at varying gas prices for each month . this value represents what the month would clear at if each hour cleared at the cap ( based on historic loads ) . while any given hour could be above this value , our calculation estimates the likely monthly average cap value ! the blue shading indicates what the caps would be given current ( 10 / 27 / 2000 nymex ) forward prices . the yellow shading indicates those forward power prices which are in excess of the proposed cap .",Safe Email

"linguistic theory dominique sportiche , partitions and atoms of clause structure subjects , agreement , case and clitics this collection builds on the theory of principles and parameters and its economy - - minimalist descendants . the essays progressively develop a view of syntactic structures in which syntactic properties are increasingly analyzed as atomized in progressively smaller elementary components and partitioned in the way these elementary components are represented . dominique sportiche argues that as a consequence of this view , languages do not differ at all in their syntactic organization . routledge leading linguists routledge : 1998 : 448 pp cl : 0 415 16926 7 : # d4946 : $ 110 . 00 laura a . michaelis , aspectual grammar and past time reference this work examines the linguistic constructions which speakers use to talk about events that occurred in the past and states which held in the past . laura michaelis argues that the fundamental conceptual division between events and states forms the basis of systems of verbal aspect in all languages , and that one cannot talk about the meaning of a past-tense assertion without making reference to the event-state distinction . focusing on english data , the author examines the semantic and functional overlap between assertions about the past and assertions involving events : when one asserts that an event of a given kind exists , one is making an assertion about the past . this semantic overlap can be evoked as a way of characterizing the close relationship between the past-tense construction and the past-perfect construction : while a past tense assertion like she left is used to describe the past , a present-perfect assertion like she has left is used to assert the existence of an event by invoking its aftermath ( her absence ) . dr . michaelis argues that the two constructions are semantically equivalent , but distinguished by their function in narrative . this study presents a semantic framework for analyzing all aspectual constructions in terms of the event-state distinction , and describes the grammatical expression of aspectual meaning in terms of a theory of grammatical constructions . in this theory , grammatical constructions , like words , are conventionalized form-meaning pairs , which are best described not only with respect to their intrinsic semantic values , but also with respect to the functional opposition in which they participate . michaelis argues that many of the otherwise puzzling grammatical constraints which characterize the english present-perfect construction can be motivated in terms of the functional opposition between present perfect and past tense . routledge studies in germanic linguistics 4 routledge : 1998 : 320 pp cl : 0 415 15678 5 : # d4385 : $ 90 . 00 asa kasher , ed , pragmatics 6 volume set the purpose of this collection is to portray the development of pragmatics as a science of language , in a such a way as to enable readers to critically assess this theorectical development . issues explored include * presupposition * implicature * discourse * grammar * communication * indexicals * psychology * sociology . this work provides highly useful references and suggestions for further reading , and has an exceptionally detailed subject and name index to enable easy and immediate access for the reader . critical concepts routledge : 1998 : 2653 pp cl : 0 415 11734 8 : # d2960 : $ 905 . 00 for more information on these and other titles from : routledge london * new york in north america : www . routledge-ny . com elsewhere : www . routledge . com",Safe Email

    Message-ID:  <3703.1033415613@dimebox.bmc.com>  | I vote for this being added to CVS, any objections?No, but using PickMarkSeen (and pick(ids)) as an alternative to
just doing	Seq_Del $exmh(folder) $mhProfile(unseen-sequence) $resultsseems unnecessary to me (that's all that PickMarkSeen does after all).
(That can be done via ""busy"")Of course, the same is true of the badly named Pick_MarkSeen which has
nothing at all to do with ""pick"" except that it (ab)uses the pick(ids) var
in the same way.   (Its name would be hard to change unfortunately, as it
is known in app-defaults files for the ""Catch Up Unseen"" menu item, but
its implementation could certainly be fixed).kre_______________________________________________

"802.11b - 11Mbps per channel over three channels in the 2.4GHz range 
(also shared with microwaves and cordless phones) at rages up to ~300 ft.
802.11a runs on 12 channels in the 5GHz range and up to around five 
times more bandwidth (~54Mbps or so) but has less range (60-100 ft). 
8021.11a also adds Forward Error Correction into the scheme to allow for 
more reliable data transmission.
Which to use really depends on what you're doing with it. Streaming 
video almost necessitates 802.11a, while streaming just audio can be 
comfortably done with 802.11b provided that there isn't much 
interference or too many clients.
Prices? Don't know... Haven't done the research. For covering a large 
area 802.11a will be more expensive due to the need for more APs. If you 
want to reach the local coffee shop, however, you will need a 
directional antenna either way.Check out http://www.80211-planet.com, they've got some good articles on 
802.11... Also, some of the best info on 802.11 security I've seen can 
be found at http://www.drizzle.com/~aboba/IEEE/.
Give me bandwidth or give me death,

' s ratings on rating watch negative by fitch . the rating of the marlin ii notes is supported by an overfund account ( pre - funded interest ) and equity commitment from enron in the form of mandatorily convertible preferred stock . the overfund account is invested in enron debt securities ( rated ' bbb + ' , rating watch negative ) , with payments used to service interest to noteholders . payment of principal ultimately relies on enron ' s obligation to remarket mandatorily convertible preferred securities . fitch currently rates enron ' s preferred securities ' bbb - ' , rating watch negative . in addition , the transaction also benefits from rights under a $ 125 million loan to azurix europe limited , rated ` bbb + ' by fitch . similarly , the rating of the osprey i notes is based on the support from the assets in the share trust used to support interest payments and an equity commitment from enron to remarket mandatorily convertible preferred stock to fund principal payments . the mandatorily convertible preferred stock has been issued and is being held in the share trust . the assets in the share trust supporting interest payments include enron unsecured obligations ( the overfund account ) as well as quarterly dividend payments on the mandatorily convertible preferred stock . while various sources of repayment exist , such as sale or liquidation of the underlying assets or an equity offering , in each case primary credit support is derived from the enron obligation to remarket mandatorily convertible preferred stock if an amount sufficient to repay the notes has not been deposited with the trustee the 120 - day prior to the maturity date , which is one of the note trigger events . in the event that the issuance of the preferred stock yields less than the amount required to redeem the senior notes , enron is required to deliver additional shares . if enron cannot or does not deliver on this obligation , subject to certain standstill periods , then the amount of the deficiency becomes a payment obligation of enron , representing a general unsecured claim . additional note trigger events include a downgrade of enron ' s senior unsecured debt below investment grade by any of the major rating agencies in conjunction with specified declines in enron ' s closing stock price over three consecutive trading days , as well as customary events of default under the notes . it is important to note that enron has not verified that the underlying assets have adequate market value to fully pay down the associated debt . fitch will continue to monitor these transactions in conjunction with the ratings of enron , corp . and will update investors as appropriate . enron ' s debt falls as company draws down on bank loans 10 / 26 / 2001 capital markets report ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . ) new york - ( dow jones ) - enron corp . ' s ( ene ) bond and bank debt was quoted lower early friday following the houston energy giant ' s decision thursday to draw down about $ 3 billion on its bank loan facilities . late thursday , enron said it had taken action to dispel uncertainty in the financial community . specifically , the company said it drew on its committed lines of credit to provide cash liquidity in excess of $ 1 billion . enron ' s 6 . 4 % bonds which come due in july 2006 were hovering just below 80 cents on the dollar , down from around 82 cents on thursday . trading activity in investment - grade bank debt like that of enron ' s isn ' t as active as the market for leveraged loans made to companies with less than investment - grade ratings . but fixed - income sources noted some offers friday for enron ' s bank debt at around 94 cents on the dollar , still well - above distressed levels . they add that banks may want to try to sell enron ' s bank debt , which is now funded following the drawdown , but at a coupon that was negotiated several months ago . that was well before enron ran into its current market turmoil . last week , the company reported a $ 618 million third quarter loss and $ 1 . 2 billion reduction in shareholder equity . the company has said that the securities and exchange commission is conducting an inquiry into transactions it did with andrew s . fastow , its former chief financial officer who was replaced on wednesday . moody ' s investors service rates enron ' s senior unsecured debt at baal , though it ' s on review for a possible downgrade . fitch inc . and standard & poor ' s both rate the debt triple - b - plus . fitch also has enron ' s debt on review for a possible downgrade , while s joe . niedzielski @ dowjones . com copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . enron sues microsoft over failed broadband services deal by michael rieke of dow jones newswires 10 / 26 / 2001 dow jones energy service ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones 713 - 547 - 9207 ; michael . rieke @ dowjones . com copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . business enron unit takes heat power group says energy firm failed bond requirements jeffrey krasner , globe staff 10 / 26 / 2001 the boston globe third c . 1 ( copyright 2001 ) the retail sales subsidiary of houston energy giant enron corp . faced expulsion last week from the new england group representing power generators , marketers and distributors . the sales unit had failed to meet bonding requirements intended to protect market participants and the group itself from unpaid bills . iso new england , which operates the power grid throughout the six new england states , urged nepool , the power industry group , to "" initiate termination proceedings "" for enron energy services inc . , according to a letter obtained by the globe . an enron spokeswoman yesterday said the company had satisfied nepool ' s requirements , and blamed the threatening letter on a series of administrative oversights , including the failure of iso new england to warn enron of previous instances when the bond fell below required levels . "" it was an administrative snafu , "" said peggy mahoney , a spokeswoman for enron . "" it ' s fixed . it ' s no big deal . we didn ' t get the paperwork in [ on time ] because it got sent to the wrong desk . it was taken care of on friday . "" according to the letter , a nepool participant faces termination if it has failed to meet its bonding requirements three times over the previous 12 months . "" having three defaults to trigger that letter does not happen frequently , "" said ellen foley , an iso new england spokeswoman . in the letter , iso ' s chief financial officer , edward mckenna , said his organization "" has been in contact with enron energy services through multiple telephone communications , and to date the financial assurance has not been cured . "" but mahoney said enron never received written notification of its previous "" financial assurance "" defaults , which were corrected almost immediately . therefore , she said , the company was unaware that the current default was the third , which begins the expulsion proceeding . in addition , she said , the current default notice was sent to the wrong person , creating the delay that resulted in the letter . "" we ' re working with iso new england to figure that out , "" she said . the recommended termination is an embarrassment to enron because the firm ' s director of state government affairs , daniel w . allegretti , is the chairman of nepool ' s participant committee , which organizes and oversees the major membership meetings in the organization . "" this is not that unusual within the pool , "" said allegretti . "" i frequently receive notices of technical defaults . "" as far as posting the new bond to correct the situation , he said , "" we were two and a half days late in submitting paperwork . "" the incident also comes at a particularly sensitive time for enron . the parent in houston has been the subject of a financial scandal in which the firm ' s chief financial officer , andrew s . fastow , is accused of profiting from partnerships he oversaw that engaged in billions of dollars of transactions with enron . the securities and exchange commission is probing those transactions , the company said monday . enron placed fastow on leave tuesday and installed a new cfo . enron ' s stock has plunged amid ongoing revelations about the partnerships and their impact on the company ' s financial strength . the company reduced shareholder equity by $ 1 . 2 billion after terminating transactions by one of the partnerships that had been headed by fastow , according to the wall street journal . enron lost $ 618 million in the third quarter . yesterday , enron ' s shares closed at $ 16 . 35 , down 6 cents , on volume of 39 . 1 million shares . jeffrey krasner can be reached by e - mail at krasner @ globe . com . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . front page - companies oct 26 , 2001 by julie earle and sheila mcnulty enron has put up a page on its website of "" frequently asked questions "" in response to a barrage of analysts ' enquiries following last week ' s controversial results announcement . unfortunately , the us energy group ' s critics have not been satisfied with the answers . nor has wednesday ' s decision to replace andrew fastow , its chief financial officer , quelled all investors ' concerns about its highly complex financial affairs . however , analysts are pleased that kenneth lay , chief executive officer , is distancing the group from mr fastow and his ties to controversial financing vehicle "" partnerships "" . "" it is a step in the right direction and we are happy to see them move , "" says ronald barone of ubs warburg . "" it ' s not the end of it . "" the shares , which have tumbled since last week ' s results , ended a shade lower yesterday , off 0 . 37 per cent at dollars 16 . 35 . but analysts warn that the shares will continue to languish well below the 52 - week high of dollars 84 . 87 until the group improves its transparency . one of the frequently asked questions following enron ' s results announcement on october 16 concerned "" a dollars 1 . 2 bn ( pounds 840 m ) reduction in shareholders ' equity "" . the dollars 1 . 2 bn was not explained in the news release on the results , but mentioned in passing by mr lay in a follow - up conference call . many analysts confused it with a dollars 1 . 01 bn charge in the earnings report . it has since been called a "" loss "" and a "" write - off "" and enron ' s staff have struggled to explain it in plain language . enron ' s official position now is that the reduction in shareholders ' equity related to a structured finance vehicle in which ljm , a private equity fund formed by mr fastow , was an investor . when the decision was made to terminate these vehicles , enron "" recorded a dollars 1 . 2 bn reduction in shareholders ' equity and a corresponding reduction in receivables . these adjustments were the result of enron ' s termination of obligations to deliver enron shares in future periods "" . the confusion over the dollars 1 . 2 bn has further undermined the credibility of enron , which is now the subject of an unofficial inquiry by the securities and exchange commission . analysts were upset they did not know the adjustment was in the offing and note that it could be seen as increasing the group ' s debt ratio , which might hurt its debt rating . mr lay held an analysts ' meeting to counter charges that enron was not transparent . but this ended with demands for daily calls with outside auditors to explain its accounts . "" i find the disclosure is not complete enough for me to understand and explain all the intricacies of these transactions , "" said goldman sachs ' david fleischer . other analysts are also concerned about potential further write - offs . salomon smith barney ' s raymond niles points to enron ' s investments in its dabhol indian power plant , its south american investments , and its remaining telecoms assets . most importantly , he says , they may include several of enron ' s other off - balance - sheet vehicles . "" frankly , we have not been able to get enough information on them to evaluate whether there is a problem with them , "" mr niles says . other us energy traders have been distancing themselves from their rival . el paso said it was facing "" a lot of questions on its accounting practices "" . additional reporting by julie earle enron in turmoil : www . ft . com / enron copyright : the financial times limited enron bonds fall as company taps $ 3 bln credit line ( update 3 ) 2001 - 10 - 26 14 : 26 ( new york ) enron bonds fall as company taps $ 3 bln credit line ( update 3 ) ( adds egan - jones lowering credit rating in 12 th paragraph . ) houston , oct . 26 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . bonds and shares fell after the company failed to reassure investors its bond rating wouldn ' t be lowered and tapped a $ 3 billion credit line because it can no longer borrow in the commercial paper markets . enron ' s stock has fallen 52 percent in the past 10 days after investors questioned the company ' s transactions with affiliated companies run by its former chief financial officer . the stock fell 45 cents to $ 15 . 90 in early afternoon trading today . ` ` people are questioning the credibility of management , ' ' said john cassady , who helps manage $ 3 billion of fixed income assets at fifth third bancorp . ` ` it looks like the guy who was supposed to do everything for the benefit of shareholders was running partnerships for the benefit of himself .

"two seperate projects this weekend.  first mod_gzip which is an apache
module to speed up serving static and dynamic mime(text/.*) web content.
the second is the compaq smart array configs for linux.before i go on much more i'll cover the following bits: the server
is running redhat 7.3 linux with all the updates on a compaq dl380.
the client is running the same on a compaq laptop.  pretty much everything
is stock redhat 7.3 - and i'm consciously trying to stick to that.------------------------------------------------------------------------
mod_gzip:
    
    there's a tutorial on linux.ie for it (thanks donnacha) but since i'm
    not an apache person this only got me part of the way.  step by step,
    this is what i did:	# cd /root
	# wget http://www.remotecommunications.com/apache/mod_gzip/src/1.3.19.1a/mod_gzip.c.gz
	# gunzip mod_gzip.c.gz
	# apxs -ic mod_gzip.c
    
    that should compile and install fine, so add the following to
    your apache configs.  i've included comments to explain where they
    should go.  my apache config is split among many files (which is
    why i didn't use the -a flag to apxs).	# put this after the last LoadModule line
	LoadModule gzip_module        /usr/lib/apache/mod_gzip.so
	# put this after the last LoadModule line
	AddModule mod_gzip.c
	# this just needs to go below the obove two lines.

compaq smart array config:   (WARNING: YOU NEED A JVM FOR YOUR BROWSER)    i searched on google for ""compaq smart array configuration linux"" and
    got a slew of hits.  one of them was a click away from this page:	http://www.compaq.com/support/files/server/us/download/14703.html    i downloaded the rpm.  installed it. and ran the server per the
    instructions.  note, the -R enables remote connections.  if you're
    running the browser locally, run it without the -R and connect
    to localhost.	cpqacuxe -R    i found that galeon didn't work.  mozilla did.  i suspect it's because
    pop-ups are disabled in galeon config, but i might be wrong.  it uses
    java which is slow and memory hungry on this laptop.  feel free to
    try galeon with pop-ups enabled if you want to.    so, point mozilla at http://yourserver:2301/ .  login as
    administrator/administrator and change your password.  then go back
    to the main page and click the little drive array graphic towards
    the bottom.  configure your array as you want (i had to add a disk).
    save your changes, and exit.  to stop the server, just do this:	cpqacuxe -stop    in my case the drive was now accessible.  i started the process of
    making the file systems by partitioning the drive.  i knew what
    it would be called, but a grep for ida on the output of dmesg
    confirmed it.	fdisk /dev/ida/c0d1    and from there i built the filesystems and so on.hope this helps some folks,kevin--

Assuming the machines are networked, let each one send a copy of its kernel to
the others.  If the drives are open-the-box-and-switch-cables, then you can
start dd'ing a floppy before you start.  If the drives are in drawers, then this
might slow you down by all of 60 seconds.Alternatively, you could use netboot.  No, I'm serious.  Set the boot sequence
to first hard disk then network.  Do NOT make any partition on the standby
active.  Have a look at the etherboot package.  One of the things it contains is
a pascal-ish language for writing boot menus.  You can write a one-liner that
basically says ""boot /dev/hda1"" (or whatever, there's example code).  IIRC, the
resulting ""bootable image"" is a whopping 4K.  The downside is you'll need a
bootp and tftp server somewhere....hth,
Ronan.

"sum : computer transcription a couple of months ago , i asked the members of this list for help regarding software for the transcription of spoken discourse . i received a large number of answers , some to my personal e-mail address , some ' public ' . in the following i shall quote some of the answers and attempt to sum up what i consider to be the most important info received on the matter : perhaps slightly off the subject a few answers spoke of the possibilities for machine-readable text : quote : ' a company named norris communication ( san diego , ca ) sells a digital recorder that breaks down audio input into machine readable code ( including ascii i assume ) ' ' norris is reputed to be only one of two companies in the usa ( maybe the world ) manufacturing digital audio recorders using so-called "" flash chips "" ( semiconductor memory chips that permit both read and write functions ) . the digitized flash memory can be "" dumped "" to a pc in machine readable code ( which i assume would include ascii compatibility - - that 's my assumption ) . i do n't have an address , but i got their telephone number from directory assistance . the company is located in a suburb of san diego , california called poway , california . the listed telephone number is 619-679 - 1504 . if that does n't work for some reason , directory assistance can be reached at 619-555 - 1212 . ' a number of answers centered around using standard word processors ' macro facilities : quote : ' i used to do this quite satisfactorily on the pc using ms word with glossary items to quickly input speaker identification , special character sequences , etc . use a style sheet for controlling formatting . i imagine that word perfect for the pc can do the same thing , especially with its macros . ' ' i ' ve made a set of macro 's which operate on a standardized form to facilitate the transcribing process . essentially what i did is simply reduce all routinely occurring series of keystrokes to one alt - or control - key . ' most transcription software seems to be available for the mac : quote : ' for the macintosh i would definitely use nisus with a macro that has been assigned a short and easy to type keyboard shortcut . from little things like this to far more complex tasks , nisus is amazing . it is truly the power user 's and linguist 's word processor of choice . from what i have seen , it is also the most worldscript - savvy word processor available . if you have n't seen it , check out the new nisuswriter 4 . 0 which should be shipping very soon if not already . ' more info may be available from this internet address : nisus . mktg @ applelink . apple . com syncwriter : quote : ' the mac - programme you mention is syncwriter , i guess . it costs some hundred german marks ' syncwriter is sold by : med - i-bit , hohenfelderstrasse 20 , 22087 hamburg , germany ( phone + 49 40 251 67 125 ) . workbench : quote : ' you are welcome to include the workbench in your summary . however , as you know the bench is not really a transcription program , though it has some features for making transcribing easier - - e . g . the transcription keypad ( with user definable strings and ca symbols ) and the ability to link and play in a loop quicktime movie audio tapes . also , do mention that distribution is limited at this time . the bench is now available on the world wide web . ' for further info , try contacting : thebench @ alishaw . ucsb . edu for dos - based computers : hiat-dos 2 . 2 : quote : ' hiat-dos was developed as a transcription programme everybody can afford ; that is why it lacks certain technical gimmicks . the price of the new version is somewhat between 40 and 80 german marks ( as far as i know ) ; it is distributed by ' : prof . konrad ehlich institut fuer deutsch als fremdsprache lmu muenchen ludwigstrasse 27 d-80359 muenchen fax : germany-089 / 21802116 . quote : ' hiat-dos is a kind of word processing program designed for processing transcripts ; thus you ' ve got a certain format in which you fill the transcript , you ' ve got certain special correction devices etc . it 's a simple tool which is more comfortable for transcription purposes than word processing programs , that 's all .

"Hindus mourn 'monkey god'
By Omer Farooq
BBC reporter in HyderabadHundreds of people have attended the funeral of a monkey which became
revered as a divine incarnation of a Hindu god in the southern Indian
state of Andhra Pradesh.
The monkey was quite old and both its hind legs were paralysedAnimal rights campaigners say the monkey died of starvation and exhaustion
after being trapped in a temple for a month by over-zealous worshippers.The animal was cremated in Anantapur district, 400 kilometres (250 miles)
south of the state capital, Hyderabad, on Sunday.It had not eaten for three weeks.Last rites were performed by priests in the village of Timmiganipally in
the presence of hundreds of devotees who had come to believe that the
monkey was a reincarnation of the Hindu monkey god, Hanuman.GarlandedOne animal rights activist said his group's efforts to save the monkey had
failed because of the blind faith of the people.
The monkey's death came a day after he and others tried to move the animal
out of the temple, but were prevented by villagers.The monkey, which was found perched on top of an idol of Hanuman a month
ago, attracted hundreds of devotees every day from surrounding villages,
as well as from the neighbouring state of Karnataka.Devotees showered the monkey with fruit and flowers and worshipped it
around the clock.'Exploited'Locals said they believed that Lord Hanuman was visiting the village, as
the temple had stopped daily rituals after a dispute between two groups of
residents.But animal rights campaigners complained that the animal was being
mistreated.They filed a petition in the state's High Court saying the monkey had been
forcibly confined in the temple.The group also alleged that people's religious feelings were being
exploited to make money.The court then ordered the local administration to rescue the monkey - but
villagers prevented officials from taking him for treatment in time.

"accents : linguistnet in the news since victor raskin kindly kept me supplied with the responses he received to his july 6 query about the westfield accents petition , i was unusually well prepared to respond when a reporter meredith o'brien phoned me july 8 to ask if i had an opinion as a linguist on the matter ; when i told her about the linguistnet discussion of it , she was quite surprised and interested to learn of the existence of such a thing , and it turned out her ediotr was too , and the result was an article which is as much about linguistnet as about accents . the first such that i know of . i contacted victor to get his permission to use what i 'd gotten from him , but of course neither of us could contact quickly enough the many linguists whose responses i was faxing to the newspaper . i figured , and victor agreed , that messages sent to linguistnet are more or less public , and that in any case this was a very good and positive opportunity for us to do some educating of the public , which we are always looking for opportunities for . i certainly hope everyone who was quoted in the article agrees that i did the right thing in making the linguistnet discussion available to the reporter . i think the reporter did a good job of it . here 's the text of her article : springfield ( mass . ) union - news , westfield edition , friday , july 10 , 1992 , p . 1 linguists criticize accent position by meredith o'brien westfield - victor raskin , a linguistics professor at purdue university in indiana , was quite perplexed when he saw an article in his local newspaper about westfield 's petition to prohibit instructors with accents from teaching elementary school students . "" has anybody else seen a weird piece in the newspaper about a measure taken by the greek mayor of a small massachusetts town with a very ethnically mixed population to prevent people with foreign accents to be employed as grade school teachers , "" raskin asked subscribers to a linguistics computer network this week . "" besides killing my own chances of ever teaching grade school over there , is this measure nonsensical linguistically ? "" he queried . responses to raskin 's question have been coming into the world-wide computer network called "" linguistnet "" all week , some from as far away as the netherlands and australia . and those who did respond had nothing good to say about the petition . raskin is one of several linguists who have assailed the petition , which has also been chastized by education officials - - including the state secretary of education - - as unfounded and racist . the school committee 's curriculum subcommittee wednesday night unanimously rejected the petition because the committee 's attorney told them it was legally unenforceable . the full committee will vote on the issue at its next meeting which has not yet been scheduled . the petition 's organizer , laura lee whitten , had no comment on the subcommittee 's decision . meanwhile , the eight linguists who called into "" linguistnet "" on their computers concluded that parents should not be worried about their elementary school children acquiring an accent from their teachers because the chances of that happening are next to impossible . network subscriber , barbara partee , chairwoman of the linguistics department at the university of massachusetts , concurs with the conclusions of her colleagues . "" what research exists on this matter makes it very clear that it would be nearly impossible to be influenced by the accent of a grade school teacher "" , she said wednesday . "" young children , almost universally , pick up their accents from their peers . "" she said if people looked at immigrant families where the children were born in this country , they would find that the children have not adopted their parents ' accent . many others agreed . "" i used to live in boston , where you can cut the local accent with a knife , and played the organ for a church in arlington , mass . , where the pastor and his wife were from the midwest , "" craig thiersch , a linguistics professor from tilburg university in the netherlands said . "" but all their children had strong ' towny ' accents . "" "" my own rather limited experience is that children are n't influenced by the foreign accents of their parents , much less their teachers , "" echoed university of georgia professor michael a . covington . "" kids get their accents from their peers , "" agreed susan ervin - tripp from the university of california at berkeley . while the linguists roundly criticized the petition , some said they could understand why some parents signed it . noting the problems some college students have in understanding some of their foreign professors , they acknowledged that a teacher 's english should be understandable . but the existence of an accent is not a reason to rule out the hiring of an instructor , they said . "" my own opinion is that it is legitimate to require that teachers be understandable to their students , but that is presumably a normal job qualification that does not require a petition , "" partee said . she said at umass , foreign instructors and professors are screened to assure their english can be understood . "" but no one has ever been disqualified because of an accent . "" [ end of newpaper article . ] in the same paper , there was a nice column by william raspberry . much of it repeats things we ' ve been over on the net ; i extract here a bit from the ending : "" as one who was taught french by a german - accented professor who used to amuse us with her talk of "" consonants and wowels , "" i understand why some parents might be wary of having their youngsters taught reading by teachers whose pronunciations are too far from standard . but what in this nation of a thousand accents is too far from standard ? and who determines it ? how much of the whole business is simple prejudice against hispanic teachers ? how does one draw the line between a legitimate interest in occupational qualification and an illegitimate interest in ethnicity or national origin ? where is the universal principle ? kant might not want to hear this , but the principle is the problem . a good principal would handle the thing without working up a sweat . she 'd listen , make some experience-based judgment as to whether a teacher 's accent might prove an impediment to beginning readers and make the appropriate assignment . she might not even be able to tell you , in close cases , what tipped the judgment one way or another , but would that really be so awful ? only if you try to make it a kantian universal . make it a principle , and you ' re stuck willy-nilly with language panels , ethnic spokespersons , teachers ' union reps and , of course , lawyers . before it 's over , people will stop speaking to each other across racial or ethnic lines , and everybody will be working to get everybody else fired or defeated for re-election . the problem , of course , will remain unresolved . as they say in massachusetts ( or would if they thought of it ) , some things can be addressed in terms of the philosopher 's "" universal law .

Date: Not suppliedAll through October, Berkeley's Mathematical Sciences Research Institute is 
hosting Cinemath, a mathematics film festival:     Permutations and Configurations: A Calculated Cinema     In this avant-garde subset of Cinemath, we explore films that have been 
    constructed using mathematical concepts both simple and complex- geometric 
    permutations, musical frameworks, even topography are among the strategies 
    that have been employed to compose and sequence film frames. Filmmakers 
    such as Oskar Fischinger and Walther Ruttmann created some of the earliest 
    avant-garde films by multiplying, dividing, and otherwise transforming 
    abstract images- including spirals, rectangles, and circles to produce 
    dynamic rhythms and harmonies. Today such visual music and motion graphics 
    are the currency of digital graphics. Anthony McCall's film performances 
    such as Line Describing a Cone create 3-D geometric shapes into which the 
    viewer can literally step. We also explore films by pioneers of 
    machine-generated and computer-produced animation (Norman McLaren, James 
    and John Whitney, Stan Vanderbeek) as well as works by contemporary 
    animators who use the computer to either generate or pattern images (Larry 
    Cuba, Paul Glabicki, James Otis). Peter Kubelka, Taka Iimura, and Standish 
    Lawder use the frame as the unit with which they create editing patterns, 
    while Kurt Kren and Paul Sharits reckon on arithmetic systems to variously 
    calculate compositional or editing patterns. Bette Gordon, Hollis Frampton, 
    and Bruce Elder figure in algorithms, group theory, and set theory to 
    graphically enliven the frame or to structure their films. While no 
    mathematical knowledge is required to enjoy these films, we count on you to 
    try to calculate the mathematical systems employed!  Link[1] Discuss[2] (_Thanks, Jef[3]!_)[1] http://www.msri.org/20thanniversary/cinemath.html

TextAloud MP3 converts text to speech and to MP3 
Listen to email, Web pages, e-books, and more on your PC or 
portable MP3 player.  As featured in PC Magazine, The New 
York Times, and on CNN.  Now available with optional
AT&T Natural Voices, the most advanced computer speech for your PC. 
Listen to a demo, then 
download your trial copy.
Lockergnome's Guide to Converting Vinyl LPs to CD is no longer free. 
Over the last 10 days, almost 4,000 people downloaded the free tome. 
Of that 4,000, close to half put in a fake e-mail address, resulting 
in a ridiculous number of bounce messages in my inbox. Add to that 
the fact that several of the clever individuals used other people's 
real addresses, which then amounted to complaints of spam from the 
address owners. It's not worth providing a free service if it causes 
Lockergnome to be labeled a spammer as a result. The crowning gem was 
the in-duh-vidual who used the name A** Hole and Chris's personal 
address to download the PDF. On a more positive note, the guide is 
now available in all six formats,  
for the minimal price of $5, complete with some additional content 
based on a couple reader suggestions.Chris may have an obsession with Peets coffee, but I'll bet he's never 
been the daily special. On my visit to St. Louis, for the 
SIC, I 
started every morning with a walk to the West Port Starbucks. 
Apparently my morning ritual was a source of entertainment for the 
employees, which evolved into discussions of a reality based TV show 
based on the concept of stalking me. I've even got the 
incriminating evidence 
to prove it.The SIC provided me the opportunity to see some cool updates to a couple 
titles, in addition to being introduced to some useful audio oriented 
titles I'd never seen before. Expect a number of reviews over the next 
several weeks, as well as extensive coverage of last week's events in 
St. Louis in the annual SIC special issue. Lori managed to score a few 
more Gnomedex giveaways while we were in attendance, so those of you who 
sign up will be coming home with even more goodies, which, by the way, 
aren't of the stressball and pen variety -- we're talking software 
titles with reg codes.

http://www.nvidia.com/If you're in San Antonio July 23-25, for this year's Siggraph conference, 
you'll want to stop by the nVidia booth (#19102). Every 30 minutes 10 
people will be competing for a NVIDIA Quadro4 750 XGL professional 
graphics solution, using NVIDIA-provided traditional art materials such 
as charcoal, pastels, crayons and paper to create something artistic. 
All artwork must be original, unpublished work. Artwork must also
incorporate the NVIDIA logo and be created on-site at SIGGRAPH during the
10-minute contest round. Judging will be based on artistry; creativity and

DreamQuest Championship Card Games
For Pocket PC, Palm, Symbian OS
http://www.dq.com/palm.htmlPlaying games on a PDA has killed plenty of my time spent waiting in 
airports around the US. With the recent porting of these three classic 
PC card games from DreamQuest, I've added some of the best in PC 
entertainment to my arsenal of PDA diversions. Hearts, Spades and Euchre 
all play in a similar manner to their PC versions, only on a smaller 
screen. Available for Pocket PC, Palm, and even the Symbian OS, you can 
play cards against computer opponents or connect to the online game room 
and challenge other players using any of the games multiple platforms. 
This is a unique experience currently unavailable for any other pocket games. Â GnomeSKIN

Rexway
http://artists.mp3s.com/artists/56/rexway.html
  
Blending punk rock attitude with country twang makes for a fairly 
unique musical experience. I saw these guys play a show in Omaha, 
back in January of this year and was blown away by their stage 
presence. Rexway rip through an opening set with enough energy to 
kick-start even the most somber crowd, moving everyone in the 
audience to their feet and setting the scene for an entertaining 
evening. As with most punk, the lyrics are equal parts politics 
and angst, with enough colorful language to drop a jaw or two. 
Tool fans should check out the countrified version of the classic 
HWAP; it's kind of like a cover tune, only more unique. If you 
are offended by 4-letter words, this band isn't for you.

Click for DetailsCroupier (NR) 1998
Drama - 94min
Reviewer's Tilt (9)Special DVD Features worth a look-Deleted scenesIn disembodied first person Clockwork style narration,  Croupier
pessimistically compares our lives to those of hapless casino gamblers.
We know the odds are stacked against us, yet we continue to play the
games. Gamblers, or ""punters"" as they are more derogatorily known,
however, play their games under the watchful eyes of the croupier
(casino dealer).  Constantly pulled by the siren song of fast money, the
croupier knows better than anyone that to play is to lose. Thus, the
cool croupier relegates himself to his addiction of watching others
lose. Jack Manfred (Clive Owen) is the croupier, raised by his croupier
father (Nicholas Ball) who taught him all the tricks of the trade.
Through his losses both in the casino and in his personal life, Jack's
father also taught Jack that the only way to win is not to play. Punters
are sorry sods; the croupier is king. From father to son, the lesson
passes -- watching others strive and falter is the only real enjoyment
in life. Despite decades of croupier training, Jack is compelled to
write the great novel burning deep inside him, yearning to escape.
Jack's publisher regrettably relates to Jack that his novel idea is
trite; stories of real life graft and corruption are what sell. When
Jack's father informs Jack of a casino opening in a small London Casino,
Jack snatches the opportunity to parlay his skill into a novel exposing
the seedy underbelly of London's casinos. Unfortunately, Jack's ex-cop
girlfriend sees the job hardening and irreparably changing Jack for the
worst. In an attempt to fool himself, Jack creates alter ego ""Jake"" to
bear the brunt of inequity, attempting to maintain Jack both morally and
physically unscathed. The absence of any clear delineation between the
personas becomes apparent when a lovely punter (Alex Kingston)
approaches Jack with a scheme to rob the casino. Jack slowly comes to
the realization that no one can have it both ways, either in the casino
or in life. You are either in the game, or you are not. Seasoned veteran
director Michael Hodges deftly crafts this tale around the subtle
talents of the ultra cool Clive Owen. Owen rules this drama, not with
flex and volume, but with glances and nods. Less is truly more, much
more, in this low budget escape from the unsatisfying blockbuster
suspense films of recent memory. Croupier proves that it is not a large
budget, but direction, dialogue and acting that drive the genre.

Not true on the choice part.After three weeks of me telling eircom that I did not in fact need nor want
their ?1800 worth of router and firewall
nor their onsite survey... for the uncapped service I actually managed to
get a 4 port modem (after asking for a 1 port modem) instead of ye olde
hardware router & firewall and eircom onsite.I would have argued for the 1 port modem... (which I had asked for), but a
Director wanted the DSL up ... and fast....Still it only took me three weeks to get (almost) what I
wanted....................................

From: Bert01. I was so poor growing up...  if I wasn't a boy...  I'd have had
    nothing to play with.02. A girl phoned me the other day and said, ""Come on over; nobody's
    home.""  I went over. Nobody was home.03. During sex, my girlfriend always wants to talk to me.  Just the
    other night she called me from a hotel04. One day I came home early from work...  I saw a guy jogging
    naked. I said to the guy, ""Hey buddy, why are you doing that?""  He
    said ""Because you came home early.""05. It's been a rough day. I got up this morning...  put a shirt on
    and button fell off.  I picked up my briefcase, and the handle
    came off.  I'm afraid to go to the bathroom.06. I was such an ugly kid...  When I played in the sandbox, the cat
    kept covering me up.07. I could tell my parents hated me.  My bath toys were a toaster and
    radio.08. I was such an ugly baby...  My mother never breast fed me. She
    told me that she only liked me as a friend.09. I'm so ugly...  My father carries around a picture of the kid who
    came with his wallet.10. When I was born, the doctor came into the waiting room and said to
    my father, ""I'm sorry. We did everything we could, but he pulled
    through.""11. I'm so ugly...  My mother had morning sickness...  AFTER I was
    born.12. I remember the time that I was kidnapped and they sent a piece of
    my finger to my father.  He said he wanted more proof.13. Once when I was lost, I saw a policeman, and asked him to help me
    find my parents. I said to him, ""Do you think we'll ever find
    them?"" He said,""I don't know kid. There's so many places they can
    hide.""14. My wife made me join a bridge club. I jump off next Tuesday.15. I'm so ugly...  I worked in a pet shop, and people kept asking how
    big I'd get.16. I went to see my doctor. ""Doctor, every morning when I get up and
    I look in the mirror...  I feel like throwing up; What's wrong
    with me?"" He said...  ""I don't know but your eyesight is perfect.""17. I went to the doctor because I'd swallowed a bottle of sleeping
    pills. My doctor told me to have a few drinks and get some rest.18. With my old man I got no respect. I asked him, ""How can I get my
    kite in the air?"" He told me to run off a cliff.19. Some dog I got. We call him Egypt because in every room he leaves
    a pyramid. His favorite bone is in my arm.  Last night he went on
    the paper four times - three of those times I was reading it.20. One year they wanted to make me poster boy - for birth control.21. My uncle's dying wish was to have me sitting in his lap; he was in
    the electric chair.

alsa-lib package, for many packages (mplayer, ogle, xine) be a problem for
the freshrpms.net packages users? As I really feel like blending ALSA in
now, especially since I've just spent some time recompiling alsa-kernel

"" particularly in light of september 11 , the fourth quarter will be particularly weak for credit rating changes , "" said john puchalla , moody ' s senior economist . "" a wide excess of rating reviews for downgrade over upgrades in the third quarter suggests credit deterioration will persist at least into early next year . "" rating reviews are significant because , unlike actual rating changes , they are not a "" lagging "" indicator , and suggest the future direction of corporate credit . moody ' s normally wraps up its reviews within three months . u . s . corporate credit quality is falling for many reasons . these include the weakening u . s . economy , an inability of marginal companies to raise cash , debt - financed merger activity and fallout from the sept . 11 attacks on such industries as airlines , insurance , and travel . for example , moody ' s in july warned it may cut comcast corp . ' s ratings after the philadelphia - based company bid $ 44 . 5 billion for at & t corp . ' s cable tv operations . then last month , moody ' s warned it may cut chicago - based boeing co . ' s ratings because of the attacks ' potential impact on demand for commercial airplanes . in the third quarter , moody ' s warned it may cut its ratings of 54 speculative - grade , or "" junk "" - rated , companies , and raise the ratings of just 11 . for investment - grade companies , the gap was even more yawning : 68 - to - 11 . and in the fourth quarter ? through friday , moody ' s warned it may downgrade 47 companies and raise a mere four . on monday , it downgraded embattled energy trading giant enron corp . , and put all of its ratings on review for another downgrade . puchalla , however , said the decline could slow next year , in part because interest rates are low and companies are managing their balance sheets more conservatively . "" lower borrowing costs and slowing debt growth should reduce debt servicing costs , and fiscal stimulus from the federal government should boost business revenues , "" he said . "" that is a positive for credit quality .

( csco ) , for example , saw an almost identical drop over a similar 12 - month period . nobody questioned the viability of cisco . the difference is that over the past few years , enron has redefined itself as a company that runs on financial and intellectual muscle - not hard assets - and that focus is getting the company into trouble now that its credibility is in question . if you ' re buying network components , you can probably stand some ambiguity in the finances of your supplier . after all , you ' re buying something you can touch . but if you ' re buying power or gas , what you ' re really buying is a commitment to deliver . if your supplier doesn ' t come through when the market gets tough , you ' re left totally exposed . in enron ' s energy trading business , then , credibility at every level is critical . for now , enron looks to be more than viable . but the company ' s asset - light strategy might not be . gross profits from trading have shrunk to 1 . 65 % in the third quarter from 5 . 26 % in the first quarter of 1998 . meanwhile , asset - heavy energy companies like mirant corp .

"" i think enron ' s approach is to get the major counterparties back on board as quickly as possible and then hope the smaller ones will follow , "" said the head of risk management at one uk utility that halted its trade with enron last week . "" they are talking with us about bank letters of credit , "" he said . "" the people that are still trading with them are doing so on a very restrictive basis .

"" we are avoiding them as counterparties - either by not trading with them or by using a ' sleeve ' ( a third party trader ) , "" said a senior trader at one of germany ' s big utilities , who declined to be named . french traders said wariness about dealing with enron had dampened liquidity although enron was still in the market on monday morning .

haven't seen enough hits so far to bother (however, I did add a really
good test for email addresses in comments).Dan

"multimedia indexing and retrieval acm sigir ' 98 post - conference workshop multimedia indexing and retrieval melbourne , australia , august 28 , 1998 call for participation background : this workshop will focus on the required functionality , techniques , and evaluation criteria for multimedia information retrieval systems . researchers have been investigating content-based retrieval from non-text sources such as images , audio and video . initially , the focus of these efforts were on content analysis and retrieval techniques tailored to a specific media ; more recently , researchers have started to combine attributes from various media . the goal of multimedia ir systems is to handle general queries such as "" find outdoor pictures or video of clinton and gore discussing environmental issues "" . answering such queries requires intelligent exploitation of both text / speech and visual content . multimedia ir is a very broad area covering both infrastructure issues ( e . g . efficient storage criteria , networking , client-server models ) and intelligent content analysis and retrieval . since this is a one-day workshop , we have chosen three focus areas in the intelligent analysis and retrieval area . about the workshop : the first focus of this workshop is on integrating information from various media sources in order to handle multimodal queries on large , diverse databases . an example of such a collection would be the www . in such cases , a query may be decomposed into a set of media queries , each involving a different indexing scheme . the interaction of various media sources that occur in the same context ( e . g . , text accompanying pictures , audio accompanying video ) is of special interest ; such interaction can be exploited in both the content analysis and retrieval phases . the second focus deals with examples of research using content and organization of multimedia information into semantic classes . users pose and expect a retrieval to provide answers to semantic questions . in practice this is difficult to achieve . building structures that encode semantic information in a fairly domain independent and robust manner is extremely difficult . a quick review of computer vision research over the last few years points to this difficulty . in many cases , image content can be used in conjunction with user interaction and domain specificity to retrieve semantically meaningful information . however , it is clear that retrieval by similarity of visual attributes when used arbitrarily cannot provide semantically meaningful information . for example , a search for a red flower by color red on a very heterogeneous database cannot be expected to yeild meaningful results . on the other hand retrieval of red flowers in a database of flowers can be achieved using color . in context therefore , examples of research using content and organization of multimedia information into semantic classes will be discussed . many systems , particularly image and video based ones require an example picture which can be used as a query ( alternatively , the user may be required to draw a picture ) . it may be unrealistic to expect an example image to be always available . thus , it would be useful to find ways of generating new queries . can nlp techniques be combined with computer vision techniques to generate such queries ? or can multimodal retrieval techniques be combined to create queries suitable for image , video and audio retrieval ? in general , a question is how can we create realistic queries for realistic systems . the third focus of this workshop is on evaluation techniques for multimedia retrieval . currently , most researchers are using the standard evaluation measures defined for text documents ; these need to be extended / modified for multimedia documents . there is also a high degree of subjectivity involved that needs to be addressed . we will focus on the following specific topics : - content analysis and retrieval from various media ( text , images , video , audio ) - interaction of modalities ( e . g . text , images ) in indexing , retrieval - effective user interfaces ( permitting query refinement etc . ) - evaluation methodologies for multimedia information . we have found that researchers pay insufficient attention to it . - techniques for relevance ranking - multimodal query formation / decomposition - logic formalisms for multimodal queries - indexing and retrieval from scanned documents - e . g extracting text from images , word spotting - as a retrieval technique for both handwritten and printed documents . - testbeds for evaluating multimodal retrieval : it would be nice to have some resource sharing here since annotating these , and coming up with a good query set are difficult participation : two types of participation are expected . those interested in making a presentation at this workshop should submit their full papers either in online postscript version or in hardcopy by regular mail to the address given below . the papers should not exceed 5 , 000 words , including figures , tables , and references . those interested in participating , but not presenting papers , should submit a statement of interest , not to exceed 500 words . this should clearly state what aspect ( s ) of the workshop reflect their research interest . these will be used to select panelists . both types of submissions are due on friday , june 5th . decisions will be made no later than friday , june 26th . in the case of paper submission , the final camera-ready papers are due on july 24th . working notes will be made available to all participants at the workshop . all the submissions should be sent to : prof . rohini k . srihari , cedar / suny at buffalo ub commons 520 lee entrance , suite 202 amherst , ny 14228 - 2583 rohini @ cedar . buffalo . edu organization : workshop chairs ( also program chairs ) rohini k . srihari , suny at buffalo ( rohini @ cedar . buffalo . edu ) zhongfei zhang , suny at buffalo ( zhongfei @ cedar . buffalo . edu ) r . manmatha , university of massachussetts ( manmatha @ cs . umass . edu ) s . ravela , university of massachussetts ( ravela @ cs . umass . edu ) program committee members : shih - fu chang ( columbia u . , usa ) david harper ( robert gordon university , u . k . ) alex hauptmann ( cmu , usa ) rakesh kumar ( sarnoff , usa ) desai narasimhalu ( isi , singapore ) candace sidner ( lotus , usa ) peter schauble ( eth , switzerland ) timetable : paper or statement of interest submission : june 5th , 1998 decision : july 3rd , 1998 camera - ready paper due : july 24th , 1998 sigir conference : august 24th - 28th , 1998 workshop : august 29th , 1998 further information : further questions may be directed to the address above , or go to the web page of this workshop at http : / / www . cedar . buffalo . edu / sigir98 / mmtr . html or the sigir conference main web page at http : / / www . cs . mu . oz . au / sigir98 /",Safe Email

Saturday, July 20, 2002Mac fans flocked to the Macworld Expo in New York to watch Apple Computer trot out new hardware, software and even a Web services plan--but it might be a challenge getting people to pay for the offerings.
Apple CEO Steve Jobs kicked off the trade show by unveiling new iPod digital-audio players and a new flat-panel iMac.The new iPod players include models built specifically for computers that use Microsoft's Windows operating system. Apple lowered the price of the existing 5GB iPod and a redesigned 10GB model, which is thinner and comes with a new case and remote control. Jobs also introduced a beefier 20GB iPod for $499. The iPod stable now includes three models for Mac users and three models for Windows users with MusicMatch software.As expected, Jobs introduced a new iMac model with a 17-inch flat-panel monitor. The model offers a widescreen display with 1,440-by-900-pixel resolution versus 1,024-by-768-pixel resolution for the 15-inch iMac.Jobs also previewed the next version of Mac OS X, version 10.2, which will be on store shelves Aug. 24 for $129. OS X 10.2 includes a new Finder with improved search features, spring-loaded folders and the ability to change the background photo as often as every 5 seconds.But fans who rushed to OS X last year learned there's no such thing as a cheap upgrade when the company announced it will not offer a discounted upgrade version of Mac OS X version 10.2, code-named Jaguar, to current users of the operating system. To get Jaguar, current OS X users will have to buy a new Macintosh or an entirely new version of the operating system for the retail price of $129.Apple's decision not to sell a less-expensive upgrade version lay in the qualitative difference between version 10.1 and 10.2. Although the versions share the same core technology, Jaguar includes several new features and services, such as search tool Sherlock 3 and Internet address finder Rendezvous, which arguably classify it as an entirely new piece of software.Apple also raised eyebrows by transitioning its iTools Web services from a free program to a paid program called .Mac. The company plans to charge about $100 per year for the program. The collection of Web services was launched about three years ago, and now includes online storage via a service called iDisk, online greeting cards through iCards and other features.Despite iTool's popularity, the company may face a tough sell with the .Mac program. The history of paid services, is not a pretty picture. Customers have bristled when companies try to slap charges on previously free services. Some have succeeded but many have struggled, especially when free alternatives lurked elsewhere. In the early 1990s, Apple's efforts to form online communities and popularize search engines failed magnificently.To its advantage, Apple has presented a fairly coherent and tangible set of services with .Mac. And although its software division is far more organized than it once was, it's unclear how overwhelming demand will be. However, an online petition protesting the new charges doesn't bode well for the program.Microsoft's moves
Not one to be caught in anyone's shadow, Microsoft plans to offer a rebate for its Office suite for Mac OS X to those who buy the software bundle when they pick up a new Mac. The promotion entails a $50 mail-in rebate for people buying a new Mac and upgrading to Office v. X, and $100 for those buying a Mac and the full version of the software.The offers come after Microsoft revealed that sales of the software have not met its expectations. The software potentate had expected to sell 750,000 copies of Office v. X by now, but instead has sold only 300,000 since the program went on sale last November.Microsoft is also putting the finishing touches on the third collection of Windows 2000 bug fixes, which is nearly ready for release after a protracted period of testing. The update, Windows 2000 Service Pack 3, contains vital security updates and hundreds of fixes to bugs plaguing the operating system that Microsoft released in February 2000. Service Pack 3 could be important for many businesses, as not all of the included security fixes are available as separate downloads.
Not everything will be available as a download, however. Weeks before Microsoft plans to reinstate Java in Windows XP, it has shut down a site that would automatically send its Java software to Windows XP users. The company closed the install-on-demand feature 30 days after it told Java inventor Sun Microsystems it would reinstate Java in Windows XP through the forthcoming Service Pack 1 but remove it altogether in 2004.Somebody's watching youYou better watch what you write in Yahoo's free e-mail service--because Yahoo is. To protect users from malicious code, Yahoo uses an automated filter to swap out a handful of words such as ""mocha"" and ""eval"" that pertain to Web code known as JavaScript.The reason is that e-mail sent in a form known as ""Web enhanced"" can contain JavaScript instructions able to run programs on the recipient's PC. JavaScript is a Web language that can issue commands such as telling the browser to open up other windows or to prompt a service to change a password, for example.""Mocha"" is one of those special commands that can be run from Web-enhanced e-mail. Typing ""mocha:"" into the location bar of the Netscape browser will open a screen with a display area and a text box underneath, in which commands can be entered. A malicious hacker could, for example, use the command line to run a program that changes a person's password without that person's knowledge.
On the heels of plans for new powers to patrol people's Web use, the U.S. government is again turning to technology to monitor suspicious activity in the name of fighting terrorism. The government has unveiled more details of its Terrorist Information and Prevention System (TIPS), a plan to recruit volunteers across the country who will keep tabs on dubious or suspicious behavior.""The program will involve the millions of American workers who, in the daily course of their work, are in a unique position to see potentially unusual or suspicious activity in public places,"" according to the TIPS Web site. But the American Civil Liberties Union, one of several critics of the plan, fears the proposal will encourage racial profiling and vigilantism, possibly leading to searches of private homes without a warrant.Also of note

"URL: http://www.joelonsoftware.com/news/20021008.html
Date: Not suppliedFeedback from my posting[1] about FogBUGZ[2] Setup fell into four categories. *""Why make Setup reversable? Instead you should collect all the information 
from the user and make all the changes in one batch at the end.""* There are a 
couple of things to understand here. First of all, even if you do everything in 
one batch at the end, there's always a possibility that some step in the middle 
of the batch will fail, and in that case, a well-behaved setup program will 
back out the steps that were already done. There are well over 100 error 
messages in the string table for FogBUGZ Setup so the number of things that can 
fail is not insignificant. Second, it's not nice to tell people about an error in their input three pages 
after they made the mistake. For example, early in the FogBUGZ setup process we 
prompt you to create an account for FogBUGZ to use: [IMG: http://www.joelonsoftware.com/pictures/setupNewAcct.gif (FogBUGZ Setup 
Screenshot)] The account creation could fail for a myriad of reasons, none of which can be 
predicted before trying to create the account. For example, the password might 
not conform to the system password policy. And different national versions of 
Windows NT have different rules about accented letters in passwords (betcha 
didn't know that!). It's better to tell the user about this problem right away 
so they can correct their input rather than having a message come up during the 
long install process later, forcing the user to back up and fix it. And even if 
you force the user to back up and fix it, you still have to undo the first part 
of the work that you did before creating the account, otherwise you've left 
their system in an indeterminate state. In any case I need to write code to create the account and delete the account 
in case something later fails; I might as well call that code on this page of 
the wizard where I can display a useful error message. And what are the kinds of things that need to be reversable? Well, in order to 
upgrade FogBUGZ without requiring a reboot (and we _never, ever _require a 
reboot), we have to shut down a couple of processes that might have been 
keeping FogBUGZ files pinned down, such as IIS (Microsoft's web server). So 
part one of the batch is ""Stop IIS."" Now if part 2 fails for some reason, it 
would be _extremely_ rude to leave IIS not running. And anyway, it's not like I 
don't need to write the code for ""Start IIS"" for the end of the batch. So the 
code to rollback ""Stop IIS"" is already written. No big deal, I just need to 
call it at the right place. I think one reason that people think you should ""gather all the info and then 
do all the work"" is because with very large installation programs that are very 
slow, this is a polite way to waste less of the user's time. Indeed even 
FogBUGZ setup does 95% of its work at the very end. But the ""create account"" 
operation is so fast, that principle simply doesn't apply here. Even our 95% of 
the work phase takes well under a minute, most of which is spent waiting for 
IIS to stop and start. *""Why did you use VC++/MFC? Surely an advanced intelligence such as yourself 
has admitted by now that Delphi[3] is more productive.""* First of all, leave 
your language religious fanaticism at the Usenet door. Somehow I managed 
to figure out_ in high school_ that language advocacy and religious 
arguments are unbelievably boring.  Secondly, even if Delphi were more productive, the only pertinent question, 
since I am writing the code, is _what is more productive for Joel Spolsky_. And 
I don't know Delphi at all, but I know Win32, MFC, and VC++ _really, really 
well_. So while I might not outcode a good Delphi programmer, I would 
definitely outcode a completely inexperienced Delphi programmer (which is me), 
certainly over a short 4 week project. Third, many of the things I needed to do 
in this setup program are things like ""grant the Logon as Service privilege to 
an account."" This is rare enough that the only way to find out how to do this 
is to search the Microsoft knowlege base and the web in general. When you 
search the web in general for how to do fancy things with Windows NT, what you 
find is about 75% C code, maybe 20% VB code, and 5% everything else. Yes, I 
know, I could translate the C code into Delphi (assuming I was a sophisticated 
Delphi programmer, not a completely inexperienced Delphi programmer), but that 
costs as much productivity as I would supposedly gain from your supposedly more 
productive programming language. And fourth, I already had about 30% of the 
code I needed for Setup in MFC format: from FogBUGZ 2.0 Setup, and a library 
I've been using for years to make wizards. *""Why make Setup at all? You already have your customers' money. Good Setup 
programs don't increase sales.""* This was actually the smartest question and 
made me think the hardest. I came up with three reasons: - Decreased tech support cost. This setup program will pay for itself over the 
life of the code. 
- Delight my customers. When I'm trying to get them to upgrade to 4.0, I want 
them to remember how painless the 3.0 installation was, so they won't hesitate 
because they are afraid to upgrade. I'm still using an old version of 
SpamAssassin that is becoming increasingly ineffective, even though I know the 
new version is much better, because I just can't bear the thought of another 
morning wasted. The very memory of the first SpamAssassin installation -- all 
the little SSH windows, some su'ed, trying to scroll through man pages and 
Google Groups, accidentally hitting Ctrl+Z in Emacs to undo and having it 
suspend, trying to guess why we can't get the MTA to run procmail, sorry it's 
too much. If SpamAssassin was making money off of upgraders they would have 
lost my business because they don't have a SETUP program. 
- Win reviews. Software reviewers always cast about for some kind of 
standardized way to rate software, even when they are comparing apples and 
oranges and planets and 17th century philosophers. They always have a 
meaningless list of things to review which can be applied to PC games, 
mainframe databases, web site auction software, and DNA sequencing 
software. And Setup is always on their list. A single flaw in setup is 
guaranteed to be mentioned in every review because every reviewer will see it 
and say ""Aha!""
*""How can we make WISE[4] better?"" *Kudos to the product manager of WISE 
Installation System for calling me up and listening to my litany of all the 
reasons his product wasn't adequate for typical IIS/ASP/SQL applications.[1] http://www.joelonsoftware.com/news/20021002.html

"Raymond L. Wallace, 83
Bigfoot Story Teller
(1919-2002)Ray Wallace, a controversial figure involved in 44 years of Bigfoot-related
events, died November 26, 2002, in Toledo, Washington.  The Washington State
construction tycoon had been ill for some time, living in a Toledo rest
home.It was at Bluff Creek, California, in 1958, which found Ray WallaceÂ¹s
company building a new road through the northern California forest.   In
August through October, Wallace Construction Company's employee Jerry Crew
found tracks of a huge humanlike foot.  Thanks to instructions from
taxidermist Bob Titmus, Crew made the first plaster casts of a footprint
from this hairy upright creature his fellow workers called Â³Bigfoot.Â²  Crew
took the cast to town, to quiet local ridicule, and showed it to a Humboldt
County newspaper editor.  The photograph of Jerry Crew with the giant
plaster of Paris foot imprint went out over the newswires.   It produced a
revolutionary shift from small regional stories of Sasquatch to todayÂ¹s
global awareness of Bigfoot. Soon after the publicized Crew finds, Wallace
and his brother claimed other Bigfoot activity around the construction site;
Wallace said he found tracks and droppings of Bigfoot.Wallace was to be involved with the local tales of hairy giants for the rest
of his life.  Allegedly in the later in the 1950s, for example, Wallace
offered to sell Texas millionaire Tom Slick a captured Bigfoot.  Wallace
failed to produce the creature when Slick came up with an offer. Down
through the years, Wallace would carry on pranks, be tied to carved fake
Sasquatch feet, and produce and try to sell dubious photographs and films.
He was a great letter writer and would pen long passages to magazine editors
about this photographs or telling of how he knew a Bigfoot was nearby
guarding a mine full of gold.  After awhile, most Bigfoot hunters and
researchers took Wallace as merely a spinner of fanciful tall tales. Through
his contributions to Strange Magazine, the Track Record, and indirectly to
Fate Magazine, Wallace relished keeping his name in the limelight of the
Bigfoot mystery.In March 1998, Ray Wallace offered a million dollars to the first person who
could bring him a live baby Bigfoot.  Saying he had tracked Bigfoot for
forty years, Wallace claimed he wanted to raise a young Sasquatch to
adulthood. Wallace told reporters he planned to raise a baby Bigfoot with
Â³care and respectÂ² and would like to train the creature to ride around with
him in his pickup truck and help out with chores around his ranch.  No one
came forth with a baby Bigfoot.Ray Wallace added an intriguing, mostly harmless story-telling element to
the otherwise often serious pursuit of Bigfoot that various friends of his,
such as Ray Crowe, Director of the International Bigfoot Society, enjoyed.Ray Wallace was interred at the Lone Hill Cemetery in Toledo, Washington
State, on November 30, 2002.Â©Loren Coleman 2002

TROUBLESHOOTING VOICE | By Tom LancasterWhen you're troubleshooting voice calls, particularly the signaling,
it's often helpful to look at the detailed output of the device, be
it a voice-enabled router, telephony server, gateway or whatever. 
This detailed output can be in the form of logs or debug output as is
the case in Cisco's IOS.  In any case, this output is likely to be
somewhat cryptic.  One of the reasons is because this output often
uses a set of standardized codes and it is simply easier to put more
information on the screen using a short number than it is to write an
essay about why some event happened.Read the entire tip at:

VoIP ENABLE YOUR TELEPHONY | By Tom LancasterOne of the reasons VoIP has been slowly gaining traction is that
large enterprises have quite a lot of legacy equipment, and migrating
to VoIP from the circuit-switched networks of yore is no easy feat.
These environments are typically complicated and the stakes are high
because so many mission-critical systems rely on telephony.Click here for the full tip:

UNDERSTANDING RELAY | By Tom LancasterEveryone knows that delay is one of the two primary causes of poor
voice quality, particularly in VoIP networks, but where does this
delay come from?  Delay is generally defined as the time it takes
from the instant you speak into the phone until the instant that
sound is regenerated on the far end. Quite a few things have to
happen to transport this sound through the system, so delay actually
has many components.Read the entire tip here:

"Ananova:Â  
Brazilian bees keep their own 'insect ranch'Scientists have found a new species of bee that behaves like a farmer by
keeping herds of insects.
The Amazonian Schwarzula use their own 'insect ranches' to provide food and
building materials.
The bees nest in holes in trees alongside 200 aphid-like insects from a
species called cryptostigma.
Cryptostigma feed on tree sap and excrete a sugar solution, which the bees
stop them from drowning in, by licking it up and turning it into honey.
The insects also produce wax from glands on their backs, which the bees
scrape off and use for their nest.
Nature reports it is the first time farming behaviour has been discovered in
bees.
Biologist Joao Camargo, of the University of Sao Paulo in Brazil, said: ""In
turn the bees provide the insects with sanitary benefits and protection.""
Writing in the journal Biotropica, Camargo says the bees might even carry
their insect ranches around the forest with them and is planning further
research on how they tend to their herd.
Studies of the Schwarzula showed the bees seemed to get most of their sugar
from the insect farms. Some bees were seen licking human sweat for salt.

( wraps financial - creditquality - moodys and financial - defaults - s & p ) by jonathan stempel new york , oct 29 ( reuters ) - corporate credit quality will likely grow much worse before it gets better , and about $ 100 billion of corporate debt will likely go into default this year as the united states heads into recession , according to reports issued on monday by two top credit rating agencies . moody ' s investors service said it put ratings on review for downgrade for 122 u . s . companies with $ 543 billion of debt in the third quarter , dwarfing the 22 companies with $ 66 billion of debt it put on review for upgrade . reviews are a leading indicator of the direction of corporate credit . "" a wide excess of rating reviews for downgrade over upgrades in the third quarter suggests credit deterioration will persist at least into early next year , "" said john puchalla , moody ' s senior economist . meanwhile , standard & poor ' s said more than 200 companies will default on about $ 100 billion of debt this year , compared with 117 defaulting on a record $ 42 . 3 billion in 2000 . it said the default rate for junk bonds - those rated "" bb - plus "" or lower by s & p and "" bal "" or lower by moody ' s because of their credit risks - will reach 9 . 4 percent by year end . moody ' s forecasts a 10 percent rate . "" the u . s . economy is clearly in a recession , "" said s & p chief economist david wyss in a statement . "" although standard & poor ' s expects it to be relatively mild and end in early 2002 , the risk of a longer and deeper downturn is high . "" both agencies said the sept . 11 attacks contributed to a deepening of a three - year slump in corporate credit quality . moody ' s blamed 38 reviews for downgrade in september alone on the attacks . costs rise , protection weakens u . s . corporate credit quality is falling for many reasons . these include the weakening economy , the inability of many marginal companies to raise cash at tolerable interest rates , share buybacks , debt - financed merger activity , and fallout from the attacks on such industries as airlines , insurance and travel . "" many companies in financial difficulties will see their funding sources dry up and be pushed over the brink , "" said david keisman , managing director at s & p risk solutions . even well - known companies are suffering rating declines . on monday alone , for example , s & p downgraded mcdonald corp . after the world ' s largest fast - food chain said it will buy back up to $ 5 billion of stock , at a time s & p said the company ' s "" growth prospects for the future are less optimistic . "" meanwhile , moody ' s downgraded enron corp . , and warned it may downgrade it again . the energy trading giant is struggling with vanishing investor confidence , reflected in a share price that has plunged by more than half in two weeks , as it tries to keep access to cash it needs to run its business . puchalla said the credit quality decline could slow next year , in part because interest rates are low and companies are managing their balance sheets more conservatively . "" lower borrowing costs and slowing debt growth should reduce debt servicing costs , and fiscal stimulus from the federal government should boost business revenues , "" he said . still , through friday , moody ' s has said in the fourth quarter it may downgrade 47 companies , and upgrade just four . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . usa : u . s . firms say deals with enron at normal levels . by andrew kelly 10 / 29 / 2001 reuters english news service ( c ) reuters limited 2001 . houston , oct 29 ( reuters ) - major u . s . wholesale natural gas and electricity traders said on monday their deals with troubled enron corp . are still running at normal levels . but some are keeping a wary eye on the company ' s finances and credit status after a downgrade by one of the major rating agencies . "" we certainly are very well aware of what our exposure is to them and watching that on a daily basis , "" chief executive marce fuller of atlanta energy marketer mirant corp . told reuters . "" at this point , i would categorize it as pretty much as business as usual with enron , but we ' ll have to keep a close eye on it as we move forward , "" said fuller . officials at companies such as houston natural gas firm el paso corp . and columbus , ohio , utility holding company american electric power co . inc . expressed similar sentiments , saying nothing had changed in their dealings with the houston - based energy company , at least for the time being . "" we continue to trade with them , "" said spokeswoman jennifer pierce of charlotte - based utility duke energy corp . . "" they ' ve always been meticulous in their credit management and we continue to see that with them , "" she added . enron ' s shares fell to yet another new low on monday as the company said it was lobbying banks for a new credit line and rating agency moody ' s investor service downgraded the company ' s senior unsecured debt to two notches above junk - bond status . since oct . 12 enron ' s stock has fallen some 60 percent after the company reported its first quarterly loss in over four years , wrote down shareholders ' equity by $ 1 . 2 billion dollars and failed to quell investors ' jitters about a series of complex off - balance - sheet financial deals . confidence crumbles analysts say that if confidence in enron continued to crumble , it could restrict the company ' s access to credit and thus create problems for its core energy trading operations . european energy industry sources told reuters earlier on monday that there was already evidence of european companies shying away from trading with enron because of credit worries . several large energy groups have frozen their dealings with enron in europe as they hold urgent talks with the u . s . group about setting up new credit arrangements , the sources said . "" they are talking with us about bank letters of credit , "" said the head of risk management at one u . k . utility that halted its trade with enron last week . "" the people that are still trading with them are doing so on a very restrictive basis . "" traders in the u . s . wholesale energy markets said on monday that they were continuing to deal with enron and still regard the company as a reliable trading partner . "" i don ' t have any problems dealing with enron , especially since i ' m doing day - ahead trades . but i have heard the rumors of people not wanting to deal with them , "" one natural gas trader in the u . s . southeast told reuters . a trader who specializes in longer - term deals in the forwards market for electricity said publicity about enron ' s woes had not yet led to any loss of market liquidity . "" obviously there ' s a concern , but the financial situation is not a factor now , "" the trader said . despite the public words of reassurance that many of them have been speaking , enron ' s major competitors and trading partners continue to monitor the situation closely . "" any time a counterparty starts looking like their credit rating is deteriorating , then that would certainly be a signal to us to become more worried , "" said mirant ' s fuller . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . enron bonds stabilize but market players are concerned by michael c . barr of dow jones newswires 10 / 29 / 2001 capital markets report ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . ) new york - ( dow jones ) - uncertainty about enron corp .

"" it ' s such a fluid situation that the market would like to see a clarification of the company ' s circumstances , "" said eric bergson , portfolio manager , northern trust global investments , chicago . until this occurs , the outlook for the company ' s bonds is choppy , he added . enron drew down about $ 3 billion in credit lines last week to increase cash reserves and calm jittery markets , buying back its outstanding commercial paper . and , it ' s currently negotiating with its bank group for an additional $ 1 billion to $ 2 billion in new credit , according to a report in monday ' s wall street journal . enron ' s troubles began earlier this month with the announcement of a $ 618 million third - quarter loss and the disclosure of a $ 1 . 2 billion erosion of investor equity related to transactions conducted with its former chief financial officer , andrew fastow . "" the company did not learn from the mistakes of others by not being ahead of the game on disclosure , "" said mitch stapley , portfolio manager and chief fixed income officer , fifth third investment advisors , grand rapids , mich . it becomes harder to regain investors ' trust , he said . moody ' s investors service lowered the company ' s senior unsecured long - term debt rating monday to baa 2 from baal . the debt is rated triple - b - plus by standard & poor ' s corp . , with a negative outlook . fitch also maintains a triple - b - plus rating and it placed the debt on rating watch negative late last week . both fitch and moody ' s cited negative investor reaction to recent company developments . and moody ' s added that its "" analysis of the developing situation will focus on management ' s success in lining up further liquidity support and on their ability to retain credit availability from their major counterparties . "" one money manager said he was concerned "" about the fallout and its impact on the company ' s ability to trade "" energy . the company ' s bonds already have suffered as a result of the uncertainty . the bonds with a 6 . 40 % coupon maturing in 2006 were offered at a dollar price of 80 on friday . many investors believe that the 80 dollar price point is a demarcation separating high - yield debt from distressed debt levels . the company ' s bonds improved a little on monday , to about an 83 dollar price .

"" we are in discussions about new credit lines , "" enron spokeswoman karen denne said monday . "" we ' re taking action to restore investor and market confidence . "" denne would not disclose how much credit the company was seeking . but the wall street journal quoted unidentified sources who said the amount is between dlrs 1 billion and dlrs 2 billion and that the deal is close to being completed . denne said of the dlrs 3 billion in credit enron cashed in last week , dlrs 2 billion of it was used to pay short term debt . currently , there are no plans for the other dlrs 1 billion , she said . moody ' s on monday placed all of enron ' s long term debt obligations on review for downgrade , citing "" substantially reduced valuations in several of its businesses . "" on oct . 16 , enron reported a net loss of dlrs 638 million in the third quarter , taking a one - time charge of dlrs 1 . 01 billion attributed to investment losses , troubled assets and unit restructurings . enron ' s stock was hammered over the next week as it became apparent some of those losses were tied to partnerships managed by enron ' s former chief financial officer , andrew fastow . concerns about a potential conflict of interest touched off an inquiry by the securities and exchange commission . enron ousted fastow last week . moody ' s said in a press release the "" magnitude of the announced charges will reduce enron ' s equity base and increase nominal financial leverage to somewhat over 50 percent while slashing earnings .

"" however , we do feel the move enron made to draw down their revolvers to pay off their commercial paper was a smart business move , "" said stephen moore , vice president at moody ' s . the rating agency said it would review the prime - 2 rating on enron ' s commercial paper . last thursday , enron announced it had tapped its lines of credit to provide more than $ 1 billion in cash liquidity and that would it use $ 2 billion to pay down commercial paper . the decision to pay off the commercial paper , he said , accomplishes two goals . "" it increases liquidity on a short - term basis , and additionally , it enables them to focus on other areas they need to focus on right now , "" moore said . "" they are working on setting up an additional facility for further capital to support their wholesale trading business . "" karen denne , an enron spokesperson , confirmed monday that the company is in discussions with banks for further financing . additional credit would help boost enron ' s liquidity position . the lingering concern for moody ' s is that there "" yet may be something else out there that gets to the credibility issue of enron itself , "" moore said . at the heart of the credibility issue are two limited partnerships - - lmj and lmj 2 - created in 1999 by former cfo andy fastow and since dissolved . enron ousted fastow last week . see related story . "" the market was unaware , "" of the existence of the partnerships , moore said . "" quite frankly , we don ' t think there is anything else , "" he said . "" but enron is huge , and if this could happen . . . there is a lingering concern that something else might happen . we cannot confirm or deny that this is true . we will be meeting soon with them to resolve issues such as these . "" moore said the meeting could come as soon as this week . "" should the wholesale trading business and the counterparties therein become impacted by these events , that could lead to the slowing growth of the wholesale business , the enron engine , "" he said . moody ' s action monday also negatively affected the ratings on two trusts - - marlin water trust and osprey , which have combined debt of $ 3 . 2 billion . marlin is now rated baa 2 , while osprey carries a new rating of baa 3 , both down a notch . the potential issue for the trusts may be "" how much equity enron would have to issue if the sale of the underlying assets alone isn ' t enough to pay off the debt . "" enron is anticipating using the proceeds from the sale of assets to meet its obligation . lisa sanders is a dallas - based reporter for cbs . marketwatch . com . enron goes begging forbes . com staff , forbes . com , 10 . 29 . 01 , 11 : 40 am et new york - enron said this morning that it is in talks with banks for additional credit , as declining investor confidence sent its stock to a six - year low and several large energy groups put their dealings with enron on hold . last thursday , the energy trader drew down about $ 3 billion from a credit line , causing its bonds to fall sharply on friday . enron ( nyse : ene ) has been scrambling to reassure investors and business partners since oct . 16 - - after the company reported its first quarterly loss in more than four years . the $ 638 million loss included $ 1 . 01 billion in charges on ill - fated investments . a week later , it disclosed that the u . s . securities and exchange commission had asked for information on partnerships run by chief financial officer andrew fastow and other executives . fastow was forced to step down from the company last week . the turmoil makes it clearer than ever that enron ' s problems weren ' t solved by the recent departure of chief executive jeffrey skilling . in these challenging times , enron deserves our thanks houston chronicle , october 28 , 2001 by bill white enron and its employees have blessed houston , and many houstonians should now take the time to say "" thanks "" when the company has experienced some highly publicized challenges . enron attracted thousands of great people to houston and changed houston ' s economy forever . the company ' s management encouraged their employees to be active citizens , and those folks responded by making a big difference in their community . enron ' s lead in shaping a nationwide market for electricity gave birth to a multibillion - dollar new industry , with houston as its hub . even while it competed hard to win in the marketplace , enron ' s example helped show other natural gas pipeline and trading firms how to move into the even bigger market of electricity . the downtown concentration of these firms - - industry leaders including reliant , dynegy , el paso and duke energy - - led london ' s financial times to refer to louisiana street as the wall street of electricity . this explosive growth attracted bright young people - - with the average age of enron employees at under 35 - - and they in turn helped fuel an explosion in residential growth in houston ' s downtown . this , in turn , helped revitalize downtown ' s retail and restaurant scene . enron ' s construction of a large class a office tower , still going up , is a milestone in houston ' s growth , an official end to more than a decade of large amounts of vacant office space . virtually every civic or charitable activity in houston learned to count on enron for both financial support and thousands of hours of invaluable volunteer activities . if enron or its chairman , ken lay , led a visionary effort , such as hosting the meeting of g 7 trade ministers , or more recently the private funding of the houston biotechnology center , houstonians knew it would be done right . without lay our town would have lost major league baseball and status as a big league town . employees know enron set a standard for hiring and promoting employees based on their potential , with no glass ceilings . women have run large divisions and subsidiaries . many military officers find that enron called on their talents after illustrious military careers , even at ages well past normal corporate entry level . the most highly recruited young people flock to a company that invests heavily in their training and then lets them rise as far and fast as their talent and ability to work hard would allow them . enron ' s corporate success reflects the stories of so many of its employees who have lived the american dream . with the habits of work learned on a family farm in missouri , ken lay got an education ending with a graduate degree at the university of houston , served his country in government and began a career in the gas pipeline business . when northern natural gas acquired the smaller houston natural gas , northern ' s chairman surprised folks by installing lay as his successor . i was at northern ' s headquarters in omaha the week after the merger 16 years ago when northern ' s chairman reassured folks that they could count on "" best young executive in the business , ken lay , "" to direct their future in a changing marketplace . within 15 years , most of enron ' s revenues and profits came from businesses that did not even exist when lay had taken over , all of which had been created from within the firm . this success did not diminish the farm boy decency and sense of fairness that attracted top talent to his team . enron rewarded innovation , while many firms afraid to alter the old formula wondered why their leadership eroded . year after year , top executives throughout the country voted enron our nation ' s most innovative corporation . enron recognized , even when financial markets do not , that innovative firms are secure enough to accept occasional failure and the inevitable price of other successes . rather than seeking insulation from the international marketplace , as had many american businesses , enron welcomed the challenge of the international market , confident that american firms could compete and win . enron also welcomed the challenge of responsible environmental stewardship , and called on industry to address the issue of global warming even as some companies feared the impact of pollution control on their bottom line . enron ' s phenomenal success created incredible and perhaps unreasonable expectations , as early this year when the stock market valued the company based on 20 percent annual growth , forever . enron ' s size and success made it a convenient target for politicians in california and india , even as enron supplied the electricity they so needed . sometimes it seemed the company ' s upstart origins as the david battling utility goliaths delayed the firm ' s perception that it had won and no longer played the role of an underdog . and so if enron experiences problems , it will learn from them , just as strong people do . let ' s not prejudge enron ' s current challenges . the more than a decade of my life that was dedicated to trying cases against companies who hurt consumers and investors taught me both to insist on the truth but never to jump to premature conclusions based on a headline or a news story . throughout its years of success , enron folks have never forgotten to find so many ways to make the firm ' s hometown of houston a better place to live and work . as enron enters a new phase of its life , let ' s not forget to express thanks and steady support . white is a houston business executive and civic leader and former government official , with no relationship to enron .",Safe Email

"aaai fall symoposium on formalizing context formalizing context aaai-95 fall symposium mit , cambridge , massachusetts november 10-12 , 1995 call for papers description the notion of context has played an important role in ai systems for many years . however , formal logical explication of contexts remains an area of research in which there are significant open issues . this symposium will provide a forum for discussing formalizations of contexts , approaches to resolving open issues , and application areas for context formalisms . the most ambitious goal of formalizing contexts is to make automated reasoning systems which are never permanently stuck with the concepts they use at a given time because they can always transcend the context they are in . such a capability would allow the designer of a reasoning system to include only such phenomena as are required for the system 's immediate purpose , retaining the assurance that if a broader system is required later , "" lifting rules "" can be devised to restate the facts from the narrow context in the broader context with qualifications added as necessary . a formal theory of context in which sentences are always considered as asserted within a context could provide a basis for such transcendence . formal theories of context are also needed to provide a representation of the context associated with a particular circumstance , e . g . the context of a conversation in which terms have particular meanings that they would n't have in the language in general . linguists and philosophers have already studied similar notions of context . an example is the situation theory that has been proposed in philosophy and applied to linguistics . however , these theories usually lie embedded in the analysis of specific linguistic constructions , so locating the exact match with ai concerns is itself a research challenge . this symposium aims to bring together researchers who have studied or applied contexts in ai or related fields . technical papers dealing with formalizations of context , the problem of generality , and use of context in common sense reasoning are especially welcome . however , survey papers which focus on contexts from other points of view , such as philosophy , linguistics , or natural language processing , or which apply contexts in other areas of ai , are also encouraged . submission information persons wishing to make presentations at the workshop should submit papers ( up to 12 pages , 12pt font ) . persons wishing only to attend the workshop should submit a 1 - 2 page research summary including a list of relevant publications . a postscript file or 8 paper copies should be sent to the program chair . limited funding will be available to support student travel . timetable april 14 , 1995 submission deadline . may 19 , 1995 submitters will be informed of decisions august 15 , 1995 final papers due september 20 , 1995 aaai will mail working notes to the participants november 10-12 , 1995 fall symposium program committee sasa buvac ( chair ) . department of computer science , stanford university , stanford ca 94305-2140 . buvac @ sail . stanford . edu richard fikes . knowledge systems laboratory , stanford university , 701 welch road , bldg . c , palo alto , ca 94304 . fikes @ ksl . stanford . edu ramanathan guha . mcc , 3500 , w . balcones center drive , austin , tx 78759 . guha @ mcc . com pat hayes . beckman institute , 405 north mathews av . , urbana , il 61801 . phayes @ cs . uiuc . edu john mccarthy . department of computer science , stanford university , stanford ca 94305-2140 . jmc @ sail . stanford . edu murray shanahan . imperial college , dept of computing , 180 queen 's gate , london sw7 2bz , england . mps @ doc . ic . ac . uk robert stalnaker . 20d-220 , department of linguistics and philosophy , m . i . t . cambridge , ma 02139 . stal @ mit . edu johan van benthem . institute for logic , language and computation , university of amsterdam , plantage muidergracht 24 , 1018 tv amsterdam , the netherlands . johan @ fwi . uva . nl ( postscript and plain text versions of this announcement are available through the symposium www page at http : / / sail . stanford . edu / buvac / 95 - context-symposium and via anonymous ftp from sail . stanford . edu in the directory / buvac / 95 - context-symposium . )",Safe Email

HOME-MAILERS NEEDED!
  
$300-$1000 PLUS WEEKLYSimple, pleasant work...you do at home.
  
  
Dear Friend,
  
Are you seeking a rewarding second income? Would you like to set your
own work schedule? Work the hours you choose? Earn extra income for
your family? If so, then we may have the answer. Current statistics show
that by the year 2010, 40-60% of the American work-force will be working
from home. Get a jump on your future and secure a job through us. Our
company provides a service to thousands of people and businesses across
the United States. With your help, we can reach and provide a better
service to more of these people and businesses, faster and at a lower cost
than our competitors. We handle a marketing program called the
Home-Mailers Program, which consists of envelope processing and mailing.
These positions require no special skills or experience, just a sincere desire
to GET STARTED, and EARN MONEY!
  
  YOU CAN EARN GOOD MONEY!!!
  
   Potential incomes range from $300 to $1000 weekly or more. Pay rate is
based on a $2.00 per envelope basis. The average Home-Mailer
stuffs anywhere from 150 to 500 envelopes a week, depending on the
amount of free time they have available. The envelopes you process will
make you a substantial income. You'll find this work, done easily and
quickly, can double or even triple your income. With just one or two hours
per day you will be excitedly surprised at how easy we've made it and how
profitable this work actually is. You can earn enough money working in
your spare time to purchase that new car or boat you've been wanting,
pay off credit cards, bills, or even take a vacation. Maybe just add more
financial security for yourself or your family. Whatever the reason, you can't
go wrong.
  
  ALL BUSINESS CAN BE DONE RIGHT FROM YOUR OWN HOME
  
  You can start the same day you receive our materials and begin receiving
money within a matter of days. These positions require no prior experience
or special skills. Under contract you will receive everything you need to
get you up and running as fast as possible. Paychecks are mailed out every
two weeks on the 1st and 16th of the month.
  
  HELP SOLVE YOUR MONEY PROBLEMS
  
   If you are looking for an excellent extra income to relieve financial
pressures, you owe it to yourself to investigate this program. Naturally, no
company can afford to send out costly materials to everyone who writes in
asking for it. Therefore, we must ask each applicant for a one time
application processing fee of $27.00. This fee covers processing and
materials you will receive upon your acceptance and is returned to you
with your first paycheck. It also assures us that you are serious about
working with our company as a Home-Mailer. We will not ask or require
you to pay us for any additional information, instructions, or materials to
stay with us, and stay with us as long as you desire. If for any reason you
are not accepted into the Home-Mailers Program, your processing fee will
be sent directly back to you. There is no hassle. However, you must act
promptly. At this time we are in need of dependable Home-Mailers in your
area, of whom may start in the very near future. There are only a limited
number of positions needed for each region of the country and as soon as
we have enough people to complete the mailing needs in your area we
will not be offering any more applications. We need your help now! So if
you're a productive, positive person we're looking forward to working with
you.
  
  SIMPLE, EASY, AND PROFITABLE, THIS PROGRAM IS THE BEST
  WAY TO MAKE AN EXCELLENT INCOME AT HOME.
  
  If this sounds like something you might be interested in, read on. If not,
thank you for your time. We hope to hear from you soon.
  
  
Sincerely Yours,Ron M. Jenkins
Home-Mailing Division Manager

  Because we are a company recruiting people from the public we must
assure you that we are the BEST company to work with and that we provide
the MOST PROFITABLE income. Because we require an initial fee to get
started, many people are skeptical, and miss out on a great opportunity.
This fee covers our expenses for materials, postage, handling, and the time
it takes us to get you started. It also assures us that you are serious about
working with the Home-Mailers Program. We know that current Home-
Mailers are happy and making an excellent income just from reading their
testimonials. This makes us happy and enables us to succeed and continue
our success together. Here are just a couple of the many testimonials
received from Home-Mailers:
  
  I want to thank you for giving me this opportunity
  to work for your company. It couldn't have come along
  at a better time. The work is so simple and the pay is
  incredible. My wife and I have been stuffing envelopes
  together part-time and are exceeding what either of us
  make at our full-time jobs. Thanks again!
     J. Thomas ------ Miami, FL
  
  Thank you for everything! I was having trouble
  making ends meet at my present employment. But
  thanks to you and your Home-Mailers Program, I was
  able to pay off some old bills and put money in the
  bank. Now I'm looking forward to taking a well
  deserved vacation.
     M. Daniels ----- Seattle, WA
  
Why do we need Home-Mailers? The cost of supplying an office is more
expensive than most people may think. The cost of office space per square
foot, + taxes employing mailing staff, + taxes employing supervisors, +
taxes, medical insurance, dental insurance, and office liability insurance,
multiplied by each region we cover, all involving paperwork, accountants
and more taxes. WE NEED YOUR SERVICES TO SAVE TIME AND MONEY!
Your role in our company is as an Independent Commission Mailer, not an
employee. We will not take taxes from your paychecks and we cannot offer
medical or dental insurance. As a Home-Mailer, your residence and many
other aspects of everyday living may be able to be declared business
expenses. Receive cash-back on your taxes! You may request copies of
personal materials at any time at no charge to yourself. All business can 
be done by mail, from your own home. You can start the same day you
receive our materials and begin receiving money within days and have a
steady income as long as you desire. These positions require no prior
experience or special skills. There are many distribution companies who
want to expand their businesses, but do not want to pay the higher 
expenses. It is much easier to have independent Home-Mailers earn 
money doing this work themselves. This program is designed to help 
people cash in with a company who needs Home-Mailers. The Home-Mailers
Program has been perfected so that it has become one of the most 
successful and profitable programs ever and is supplying people around the
world with excellent primary and secondary incomes. We invite you to take
part in our success. The money you earn is up to you. We do not require 
that you mail a certain number of envelopes each week. You can take on
whatever amount of business that fits your schedule and you can stop
whenever you want, there are no obligations. There is no need to do any
door to door selling or phone soliciting. You may work in the comfort of your
own home, choose your own hours, set your own pace. No need to leave
your present job. Form workshops with your friends or get the whole family 
to join in. The possibilities are UNLIMITED!
  
  DUE TO COMPANY EXPANSION
  YOUR SERVICES ARE NEEDED NOW.
  Thank you, and we're looking forward to working
  with you, together in the future.

"Hi folks,I decided to upgrade the kernel on a machine at home from 2.2.18pre21 to the latest from kernel.org which is 2.4.19.However I have encountered one problem, my network card now dosent work, well kind of dosent work...Instead of one eth0 on IRQ 10 I now get:
Aug  4 11:31:51 mira kernel: eth0: 3c5x9 at 0x220, 10baseT port, address  00 10 5a 3e 0e 48, IRQ 5.

Aug  4 11:31:51 mira kernel: eth1: 3c5x9 at 0x300, 10baseT port, address  00 10 5a be 0e 48, IRQ 10.
Aug  4 11:31:51 mira kernel: 3c509.c:1.18 12Mar2001 becker@scyld.com
Aug  4 11:31:51 mira kernel: http://www.scyld.com/network/3c509.htmlThis results in the interface(s) coming up but while packets can go out they can not come in.I've tried not loading the 3c509 mdule on bootup and then `modload 3c509 IRQ=10` bit it still gets loaded as above, on IRQ 5 and 10. On 2.2 it loads to IRQ 10.Anyone got any suggestions on what to do here? Its a debian 3.0 distro. This works fine when booted to 2.2 so the hardware/BIOS etc seem ok, so it seems to be 2.4 spacific. Have I missed some kernel setting?Cheers,

"I guess the first question here should be does anyone have some
updates to the PGP code in EXMH that I should know about?My current problem is that if I get a PGP signed message, I first
get a button that reads:
	""Check the signature with GnuPG""
If I punch the button, and I dont have the signature on my keyring
then I get a message saying just that, and the message:
	""Can't check signature: public key not found""
along with a button with the inscription
	""Query keyserver""
If I punch the button then EXMH just hangs.  Forever.If instead of punching the button, I go out to the keyserver myself
and then try the message again, everything works, so it SEEMS that it
must be the code that goes out to the keyserver.Anyone else with this problem?

"new book : atomism and binding atomism and binding edited by hans bennis , pierre pica and johan rooryck the state of the art in binding : everything on reference , coreference , nonreference and disjoint reference , and more on boundedness and freedom . the sixteen papers in this new volume provide a representative overview of the broad range of issues relevant to the study of binding phenomena in the generative framework . since the inception of the theoretical interest in co-referential relations in generative grammar , there has been a debate with respect to the question as to whether and how ( co ) - reference should be represented in the grammar . notions such as "" ( co ) - indexation "" , "" disjoint reference "" , "" free "" and "" bound "" play an important role in this discussion . their relevance is explicitly analyzed in many articles of this volume . the role of thematic information in binding theory constitutes another important line of inquiry elaborated on in this book . various contributors to this volume argue that thematic information largely influences binding phenomena , although the specific proposals expressing this relation differ quite substantially . another issue pursued here is related to the discussion whether binding theory is a component of sentence grammar . many papers address this issue quite explicitly and delineate the respective roles of sentence and discourse grammar in novel and intriguing ways . the volume contains the following contributions : stephen berman & arild hestvik : "" split antecedents , noncoreference and drt "" ; george aaron broadwell : "" binding theory and switch-reference "" ; hamida demirdache : "" condition c "" ; robert fiengo & robert may : "" the semantic significance of syntactic identity "" ; zygmunt frajzyngier : "" pronouns and agreement : systems interaction in the coding of reference "" ; robert freidin : "" binding theory on minimalist assumptions "" ; jeff gruber : "" a configurational approach to thematic binding "" ; james higginbotham : "" a plea for implicit anaphors "" ; hajime hoji : "" sloppy identity and principle b "" ; jan koster : "" anaphora and the uniformity of grammar "" ; howard lasnik : "" levels of representation and the elements of anaphora "" ; seth minkoff : "" on the syntax of local and logophoric control "" ; gertjan postma : "" logical entailment and the possessive nature of reflexive pronouns "" ; eric reuland & sigridur sigurjonsdottir : "" long distance ' binding ' in icelandic : syntax or discourse ?

50 TIPS TO MAKE WINDOWS MORE USEFUL 
Do you have to deal with Windows on a daily basis? Might as well 
maximize your time with it. You'll find that some of these tips 
will apply to other operating systems, too. The world of computing 
isn't so mysterious once you understand how it works. With this 
GnomeTome, you'll begin to work faster - and smarter. 
Download Windows Productivity Tips now!  I did a lot this weekend, but I didn't really get much done, 
ya know? My knees are killing me from hauling stuff out of 
the basement for storage up in the attic, but the pile only 
made it as far as the kitchen. Then I stripped and painted 
the floor where that collection of stuff was previously 
stored, and erected some shelving so I'd have room for more 
stuff. I woke up the next morning discover a very sick 
ferret, likely from the fumes that leeched into the next 
room over despite the ventilation I had setup to prevent the 
migration of bad air. So, I ended up dismantling the ferret 
cage to move it upstairs for a week or so until I'm sure 
it's safe. Thankfully, all critters are doing well now.I also started in on replacing the cheapo rusted screws 
with stainless steel deck screws out back, but found that 
the ones I picked up are too weak, leaving me with stripped 
out heads and bent shafts. That project stopped after barely 
getting started. The front steps are also in need of rust-
proof screws, but they are made from much softer wood, so I 
moved the tools to the other side of the house. Two-thirds 
of the way through the first row, I found that the extra 
1/2"" on the screws I purchased was too much and I began 
running into the top of the old concrete steps underneath. 
Figures. Live and learn. Oh well, it was entirely too hot to work outside anyway. 
Back down to the basement I went to geek out instead. 
Roughly an hour into geekitude, I glanced over and realized 
it was 78.7 degrees in the basement and I was virtually 
stuck to my chair from the sweat. I shut off as much as I 
really could and still work on a couple of projects, but it 
didn't help the heat situation much. It was just too hot 
outside for the air conditioner to keep up with the added 
heat from the computers. That left me in need of a shower 
and with only the notebook in the living room for the 
balance of the weekend. I cleaned out a lot of ancient 
email, which was nice, but nothing really got accomplished 
otherwise. Boy, am I tired. And the weekend is so far away.Hey, the second season of M*A*S*H comes out on DVD 
tomorrow! That should put me in better spirits. I could 
watch M*A*S*H for hours on end. In fact, I often do just 
that. The only kink is that the episodes don't play back-to-back 
from DVD. I'm going to play with AppleScript on the Mac 
to see if I can customize how the individual discs play. In 
theory, I should be able to make a disc play all the way 
through. If I succeed, I'll be sure to share the script 
technique in the AppleCore newsletter. Too bad I can't do that with a stand-alone DVD player.See You in August,Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Randy NielandÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â GnomeNETWORK
Slow File Save Dialog Boxes
Pointed out by Ian Hargreaveshttp://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;q321126
I've hated this one for a long time, and now we have a 
hotfix and a workaround, so take your pick as to which will 
work best. I often map drive letters to specific network 
shares, and if I happen to have a system turned off, I'll 
notice a significant delay when clicking the drop-down boxes 
in Open, Look In or Save In/As dialog boxes. Windows 2000 
attempts to reconnect to mapped resources before showing you 
the list, and depending on how many drives you have mapped 
and how many of those resources are unavailable, it can take 
eons just to save a file. A workaround is to use the My 
Network Places functionality instead of mapping drive 
letters. Fine for some, but I prefer having drive letters 
mapped for many things, being that I work at a command 
prompt quite a bit, and it's easier to navigate that way. 
Alternatively, a hotfix is now available, but you'll have to 
contact Microsoft to obtain the fix if that's the route you 
choose.

Customized 9x/ME Blue Screen Errors
http://www.vsres.com/blscrn/
We've all seen 'em. Those annoyingly incoherent blue 
screens indicating a system error of some sort, but provide 
no real help in solving the problem. If you're a programmer 
that has had to deal with error conditions produced by 
Windows 95/98/ME, then this might be a better way to handle 
them within your applications. Blue Screen v1.21 is an 
ActiveX control that uses the standard Windows system error 
functions, but provides a way to pass along text and 
response options you designate. Note that this is not 
functional on Windows NT/2000/XP, which handle system errors 
in an entirely different manner.Gamers Beware of Intel 845G Chipset
http://www.theinquirer.net/?article=4532
http://www.theinquirer.net/?article=4513
Discount the AMD hype and returned volley from Intel when 
reading up on all of this, but one thing is painfully clear. 
The Intel 845G chipset and P4 Celeron processors really 
don't provide an acceptable gaming experience. Not only is 
performance subject to ridicule, but compatibility is also 
looking to be a serious matter. Intel has never claimed that 
Celerons were high-end desktop processors, but they have 
typically provided a decent enough experience that they can 
make for acceptable machines for the more budget-minded 
consumer. The compatibility issues with this particular 
version of Celeron and the 845G chipset are something to 
watch out for. Once the Celeron is moved to the .13 micron 
core, I suspect the performance concern won't remain, but 
the 845G alone seems to have it's own problems without 
adding the Celeron misery. The lesson in knowing what 
hardware you're buying is what's important here.Â GnomeALERTZ

Test Drive Compaq Servers

Compaq (Ok, HP) offers a set of servers running various 
*nix operating systems, as well as Oracle 9i, for test 
drive. Just register for an account and you can tinker 
around with Linux, FreeBSD or even Tru64 Unix running on an

systems are all-the-rage among overclockers and those 
that seem to need bragging rights over their friends' computer 
systems. Hitachi is taking a chapter from that tome and 
applying the concept where it's truly needed - notebook 
computers. Believe me when I say that these suckers get very 
hot. I spend half my life with notebook planted on lap, and 
I have to put something between the two surfaces to avoid my 
own little heat stroke. Fans and the mini water cooling 
system Hitachi is implementing provide roughly the same heat 
mitigation efficiency, but without the noise. The concept of 
a water-cooled notebook sounds a little odd, but I would 
welcome the elimination of the turbine droning with open 
arms.

"conflict with aep / cp & l over tex - mex presidential permit no action needed on your part , but just in case you hear something through the grapevine , here is current situation : summary - aep / cp & l have economic interests in the brownsville area which are best served if we do not locate our tie in brownsville public utility board ' s ( bpub ' s ) service territory and bpub does not obtain the system upgrades which would be justified by our tie . - aep is trying to stall our presidential permit application and to coerce us into moving the tie onto their system . - bpub sees this as an attack on their interests and is planning to challenge aep . - 5 mou ' s have been signed with customers and discussions are continuing with 12 others , who have all been met and have expressed interest . - we are optimistic that the pp will be issued and standard ercot treatments will prevail , but we will likely be delayed to sometime early next year . history - enron filed presidential permit ( pp ) application - cp & l ( owned by aep ) intervened against the application and raised some technical issues - doe asked enron and cp & l / aep to meet and resolve issues - meeting occurred between enron and cp & l / aep . general technical solutions were identified , with specific solutions to be determined through a sps study . - enron drafted a letter outlining the points covered in our meeting with cp & l / aep , intending to have the letter signed by both of us and forwarded to doe , requesting that doe proceed with issuing the pp . - ap & l / aep refused to sign the letter and are now arguing that an sps scheme is not sufficient for the proposed tie location ( although aep operates under sps elsewhere within ercot , they argue that ours is a special case . independent opinion ( and our own ) is that there is little merit to the cp & l / aep position ) . - aep have told us that if we move the tie to a location west of brownsville ( on aep ' s proposed line expansion ) , that they would drop all opposition . - aep / cp & l have since approached the ercot board arguing that cost studies should be done on alternate tie locations and the system cost impact thereof . - aep / cp & l have submitted to the ercot board that enron should be responsible for any costs associated building the tie at anything other than the least - cost ( system perspective ) location . current status - brownsville ( bpub ) are incensed at aep / cp & l ' s behaviour and are planning the following actions : - making submission to ercot that : - bpub informed ercot of the project 14 months ago and no further studies or committee reviews by ercot should be necessary . - no changes to current ercot procedures should be contemplated and the tie should be viewed as a firm , native bpub load - bpub lawyer is drafting letter to go to aep demanding that aep honor their previous agreement with bpub to be supportive of bpub projects . - bpub ceo , engineer and lawyer will visit puc - t next week to make the case that no special arrangements should be made with regard to enron or bpub needing to pick up additional system costs - at this point , bpub is highly motivated and is striking out with an aggressive representation of their position as there are implications for them which go beyond the current project . furthermore , there is little love lost between bpub and aep . - although moving to the aep - proposed location would remove aep as an obstacle , we would lose the work done to date preparing with bpub and would probably make an enemy of bpub . - bob franks ( regulatory ) , scott laidlaw ( engineering / technical ) and myself are coordinating with bracewell patterson ( regulatory advisors ) on enron ' s strategy and level of support for bpub .",Safe Email

	When I do that, it just moves my mouse to the very edge of a window
(probably trying to center it on the off-screen window in question.) 	I'll have to try it with another window manager and see if I can
get exmh to put it back inside of sane boundaries. I don't have this
problem with any other windows, though. Just the exmhunseen window.Pat_______________________________________________

"re : risk metrics i completely agree with you . nevertheless , i am sorry if i did not make myself clear when we talked about this last tuesday : i am not advocating penalizing business units because of their lweek rovars or sharpes . i would certainly not set traders ' bonuses based on these numbers ( nor do i think anyone at enron would consider doing that ) . enron focuses on long term profit and risk . however , the long term is made up of many short terms , and catastrophes can occur if a company ' s management does not pay close attention to the latter . indeed , enron management is very interested in short term profitability ( they want to be notified of very large 1 and 5 day losses ) and short term risk ( we report daily var limit violations ) . in this spirit , i am simply offering 1 and 4 week rovars and sharpes as something interesting and useful that we can now produce from the dpr database , and i will let upper management use or ignore them as they see fit . regards , eugenio naveen andrews @ enron 09 / 08 / 2000 11 : 13 am to : eugenio perez / hou / ect @ ect cc : ted murphy / hou / ect @ ect subject : risk metrics eugenio , in regard to your recent e - mail concerning rovar , sharpe and other risk metrics , and our meeting on tuesday , it is imperative to understand that ( 1 ) while p & l is a number one can aggregate on a daily basis , var numbers on 1 - week or 4 - week basis , and consequently rovar numbers , are not meaningful operationally ( ie , trading activity and senior management decision - making ) and statistically . rovar and sharpe were designed to measure business unit performance over extended time periods ( preferably a year ) . specifically , you cannot penalize , or make reasonable business decisions about a unit , because of their 1 - week rovar or sharpe . ( 2 ) significant trading activity at ene is composed of long - term strategic trades ( seasonal plays with durations of over 6 months , perhaps ) , wherein desk heads and senior management have an intuitive feeling for their rovar ( over 6 months ) . a 1 - week or 4 - week "" interim "" number in this case is not useful . traders might purposefully want to make a certain 1 - week or 4 - week rovar low in their trading activity if they believe their 6 - month number can be high . in such a case , a 1 - week number might send dangerous messages to senior management . ( 3 ) conceptually , p & l and var , in isolation , are numbers which are sound and rigourously calculated . the ratio , however , one has to be careful about . the numerator ( cumulative p & l over a certain period ) can be aggregated by simple arithmetic summation , no problems . however , the denominator ( average daily var over a certain period ) relies on the underlying assumption that each point in your time series is independent and correlationless . to get a sufficient statistic for the denominator , one would have to take a large sample in your series ( 6 months or more ) , for a daily average var number to be meaningful , statistically . ( 4 ) the rac group has instituted similar metrics which have been in usage for over two years . the numbers are shown to the b . o . d with the express intent of comaring business unit performance on a 6 - month or yearly tenor . please contact matthew adams ( rac ) or myself to make sure that we are on the same footing regarding the actual calculation of such metrics . also , in the future , just to be consistent and on - the - same - page , please contact me or mr . adams if any risk - related numbers are to be showcased in a public forum . ( 5 ) finally , as you can probably corroborate , senior management might not be fully versed on the nuances of var , let alone 1 - week var ratios . therefore , one has to be wary of the misuse of ratios and risk metrics . i liked your presentation of your database on tuesday . i think it is a nice step in aggregating and dissecting p & l from disparate sources . best regards naveen",Safe Email

FreeBSD only:   NOI.   BackgroundThe Network File System (NFS) allows a host to export some or all of
its filesystems, or parts of them, so that other hosts can access them
over the network and mount them as if they were on local disks.  NFS is
built on top of the Sun Remote Procedure Call (RPC) framework.II.  Problem DescriptionA part of the NFS server code charged with handling incoming RPC
messages had an error which, when the server received a message with a
zero-length payload, would cause it to reference the payload from the
previous message, creating a loop in the message chain.  This would
later cause an infinite loop in a different part of the NFS server
code which tried to traverse the chain.III. ImpactCertain Linux implementations of NFS produce zero-length RPC messages
in some cases.  A FreeBSD system running an NFS server may lock up
when such clients connect.An attacker in a position to send RPC messages to an affected FreeBSD
system can construct a sequence of malicious RPC messages that cause
the target system to lock up.IV.  Workaround1) Disable the NFS server: set the nfs_server_enable variable to ""NO""
   in /etc/rc.conf, and reboot.   Alternatively, if there are no active NFS clients (as listed by the
   showmount(8) utility), just killing the mountd and nfsd processes
   should suffice.2) Add firewall rules to block RPC traffic to the NFS server from
   untrusted hosts.V.   SolutionThe following patch has been verified to apply to FreeBSD 4.4, 4.5, and
4.6 systems.a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.# fetch ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/patches/SA-02:36/nfs.patch
# fetch ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/patches/SA-02:36/nfs.patch.ascb) Apply the patch.# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patchc) Recompile your kernel and modules as described in
 and reboot the
system.VI.  Correction detailsThe following list contains the revision numbers of each file that was
corrected in FreeBSD.Path                                                             Revision

* Judge Grants Consumer Voice in ReplayTV Lawsuit  Hollywood Tries to Skip Over Consumers' ConcernsLos Angeles - Judge Florence Cooper today granted five ReplayTV owners
a voice in the court debate over their rights to record television
programs and to skip commercials using digital video recorders (DVRs).
The federal court denied the entertainment industry motion to dismiss
the ReplayTV owners' lawsuit and agreed to combine the consumer
lawsuit with an entertainment industry lawsuit filed last fall to ban
ReplayTV DVRs.""We're pleased the court has recognized that the debate about digital
video recorders must include the customers who purchase and use the
devices,"" said Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) Intellectual
Property Attorney Robin Gross.""[T]he issue of whether the Newmark Plaintiffs' use of the ReplayTV
DVRs' send-show and commercial-skipping features constitutes fair use
will most likely figure prominently in both the ReplayTV action and
the Newmark action,"" wrote Judge Cooper in her opinion.Responding to the entertainment industry's lawsuit against DVR
manufacturers, EFF petitioned the court on behalf of the five ReplayTV
owners to declare legal their use of the digital devices also known as
personal video recorders (PVRs). EFF seeks to ensure that the legal
debate over DVRs will include consumers' concerns along with those of
the entertainment and consumer electronics industries.The entertainment industry claims that commercial skipping infringes
copyright and digital recording aids piracy.""I'm not a crook if I skip commercials or share a news interview of
myself with my mom using the SendShow feature rather than sending her
a videotape,"" said Craig Newmark, founder of craigslist.org and a
ReplayTV owner. ""I shouldn't have to worry about getting prosecuted,
but the Turner Broadcasting CEO tells us that taking a bathroom break
is criminal. We even have Senators urging Attorney General Ashcroft to
prosecute people who share files.""Along with Newmark, ReplayTV customers filing the lawsuit with legal
representation by the EFF are: Keith Ogden, owner of a financial
broker firm in San Francisco; Shawn Hughes, a small business owner in
Georgia; Seattle journalist Glenn Fleishman; and southern Californian
video engineer Phil Wright.Links:For this release:

* Musician Disputes Industry's Stance on Music Sharing  Janis Ian Urges Artists Speak Out, Support Free DownloadsSan Francisco - Grammy-winning songwriter and recording artist Janis
Ian today challenged the music industry by celebrating peer-to-peer
(P2P) music sharing as a boon to musicians.Ian, who is in the San Francisco Bay Area as part of her current
concert tour, recently published ""The Internet Debacle,"" a pointed
critique of the music industry's disregard for musicians and consumers
who want to distribute and acquire music online. The Electronic
Frontier Foundation (EFF) applauds Ian's actions and hopes that others
will see the Internet as an aid, not a threat, to musicians.In the article, Ian assails the major record labels' argument that P2P
file-sharing is harming artists.""Free Internet downloads are good for the music industry and its

for whatever reason, can reach literally millions of new listeners,
enticing them to buy the CD and come to the concerts.""She adds that during the heyday of Napster she saw a marked increase
in CD sales from her website. She attacks technological and political
measures meant to harm consumers by restricting their right to copy

* Court Hearing Set in DeCSS Publication Jurisdiction CaseOn September 5, 2002, the California Supreme Court will hear oral
arguments about whether a California court has jurisdiction over
Matthew Pavlovich, an Indiana college student who is a resident of
Texas, for his hosting of an Internet mailing list. Pavlovich
maintained the mailing list for the LiVid programming group, which
provides a unified development and user resource center for video and
DVD-related work for the Linux operating system. One of the group's
projects was to create a DVD player for computer systems that run
Linux. As part of that effort, DeCSS, a program that decrypts the copy
protection on DVDs, was published on the group's mailing list. The
entertainment industry has sued Pavlovich in California court, and
last year a California appellate court ruled Pavlovich was within the
state court's jurisdiction since he published information that relates
to the entertainment industry, which is based in California.EFF and Pavlovich's legal team argue that Pavlovich is outside of
California's jurisdiction since he was a college student in Indiana
with no contacts to California when DeCSS was published on the LiVid
list. The hearing on September 5 will take place in San Francisco.

the paisanos (who leave behind those who
remain on a patron's rural land) move to
Manila, and (the second assumption) squat
in shantytowns there, at least until they
can line up a middle-class job.So, going on two large assumptions, I can
come up with a scenario under which title
would take 20 years: a shantytown arises
somewhere in the midst of a section (or
whatever the Spanish used to divvy up the
land) and it takes decades of arguing to
put together a package which somehow can
both compensate the owner and record lots
for the inhabitants.  Just transferring
title to an existing lot, between parties
who have money, ought not to be a problem.The obvious solution, at least to us
barking farting chihuahuas on FoRK, is
to ""introduce market mechanisms"".  It is

  Sun Micro Outlines Roadmap for Managing Networks 
  Friday September 20, 5:00 am ET 
  By Peter Henderson   SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Computer maker Sun Microsystems Inc. on Thursday
  said it would create in a few years a network environment that will be as
  straightforward to handle as a single machine, a strategy it calls N1.  It laid out a road map for a new layer of intelligent software and systems that will meld
  unwieldy networks into easy-to-use systems, a goal similar to those of most rivals
  making computers which manage networks. 
  EMC Corp. announced this week software aimed at allowing users to manage storage
  resources as a pool. Hewlett-Packard Co has a Utility Data Center, designed for
  broader management. International Business Machines Corp's project eLiza is working
  to make computers ""self-healing"" when systems break.  ""Applications still have to run zeroes and ones on some computing engine but the
  whole idea behind N1 is you stop thinking about that. You don't think about what box
  it is running on,"" Sun Vice President Steve MacKay, head of the N1 program, said in an
  interview on the sidelines of a Sun user conference.   Many industry executives see computer power eventually being sold like power or
  water, as a utility that can be turned on or off, in whatever volume one wants whenever
  needed. 
  For that to happen computers must be tied together seamlessly, rather than cobbling
  them together with tenuous links, as most networks do today, experts say. There are
  still major barriers, though, such as communications standards for machines from
  different vendors to interoperate closely. 
  Sun promised to deliver a ""virtualization engine"" that would let administrators look at
  their entire network as a pool by the end of the year. Network administrators today
  often have no automatic system to report what is in the network.   ""It'll tell you what you have and how it is laid out,"" promised MacKay
  The second stage, beginning in 2003, would allow users to identify a service, such as
  online banking, and allocate resources for them with a few clicks, Sun said. 
  Finally, in 2004, Sun's software should allow networks to change uses of resources on
  the fly in response to changing needs, such as a bank assuring quicker online response
  time for priority users, the company said.

millions of euros bounty for his head, so he has gone into hiding
under police protection for a few years.Or maybe some handful of Muslims are acting uppity and dragging him to

dem da massive respect dat dey deserve, especially these days.Or maybe some journo is trying to fill column inches on a boring day.
BTW I read Houellebecq's ""Extension du domaine de la lutte"" recently,
about a depressed computer services dude working in Paris, looking for
love and not finding it, slowing losing his marbles and trying to get
a friend of his to kill a woman, and ending up in a clinic for
nutcases...  Yikes!  Purposely provocative, very depressing, with some
unbelievably boring passages where the anti-hero writes little stories
about animals talking philosophical mumbo-jumbo to each other, quoted
inline in full for pages on end.It starts out:""On Friday evening, I was invited to a party with some colleagues from
work.  There were about thrity of us, all professionals aged from
twenty-five to forty.  At one point, some cunt started getting
undressed. She took off her T-shirt, then her bra, then her skirt, all
the while making unbelievable faces.  She pranced around for a few
seconds, then she started getting dresesd again because she didn't
know what else to do.  Anyway she never sleeps with anyone.  Which
underlines the absurdity of her behaviour.After my fourth glass of vodka I started to feel pretty bad so I had
to go lie down on a bunch of cushions behind the couch.  Shortly after
that, two girls came and sat on the couch.  Those girls are not pretty
at all, the two fat office cows actually.  They go to eat together and
read books about the development of language in children, all that
sort of stuff.""... and it's downhill from there!

( ene ) in the past two weeks , the stock is trading at about its book value , begging the question : so how much is it worth anyway ? the answer is far from easy . ever since enron metamorphosed from a stodgy gas pipeline company into what was seen by many as a dynamic energy trading firm , the company has become increasingly more difficult to understand . just a glance at the wide - range of wall street analysts who follow the company illustrates the point . in the mix are analysts who track natural gas and the pipeline industry as well as those who follow electric utilities . one enticing prospect is that the assets in its portfolio are valuable in and of themselves and could be seen by some as worthwhile acquisition targets . by enron ' s own definition , the company houses four main divisions : enron wholesale services , enron energy services , enron transportation services , and enron broadband services . wholesale services houses the company ' s energy marketing business and enrononline . this segment accounts for the bulk of enron ' s profits , and has become synonymous with what enron means to most people today . not only does enron trade gas , oil and coal , but it also trades commodities such as pulp and paper , petrochemicals , lumber , plastics and even weather risk . enron energy services is the company ' s retail arm . the company provides electricity , gas and commodity risk management services through this division . enron transportation services operates four natural gas pipelines that span about 25 , 000 miles and have a peak capacity of 9 . 8 billion cubic feet per day . through these pipelines the company says it transports about 15 % of the natural gas the u . s . needs . the segment also includes portland general , a oregon utility company enron is selling to northwest natural gas co . ( nwn ) for $ 1 . 9 billion in cash and stock . in addition , the company provides bandwidth and network services through its enron broadband services division . but enron ' s reach is even wider than this list suggests . the company also has a number of other corporate investments , including its stake in the azurix water business , enron renewable energy corp . as well as methanol and mtbe plants . through enron ' s unconsolidated affiliates , the company also has investments in additional water assets , a power plant in india and a natural gas pipeline in argentina among other things . what makes any valuation of enron difficult is what remains unknown about the company ' s financial structure . enron has yet to file a balance sheet for the third quarter , and doesn ' t expect to do so until nov . 15 , when balance sheets must be filed under securities and exchange commission regulations . without the balance sheet , some of the details needed for calculating a company ' s value are missing . also , much still remains unknown about the company ' s obligations to its off - balance sheet financing vehicles . using what is known about enron ' s finances , several analysts have arrived at their own conclusions about valuation . merrill lynch 201 - 938 - 5166 ; christina . cheddar @ dowjones . com copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . enron ' s stock jumps amid takeover speculation by juan . a . lozano associated press writer 10 / 31 / 2001 associated press newswires copyright 2001 . the associated press . all rights reserved . houston ( ap ) - after plummeting to a nine - year low following recent economic losses and an investigation by federal securities regulators , shares of enron corp . jumped nearly 25 percent wednesday amid speculation the company was ripe for takeover . shares of enron , the nation ' s largest natural gas and power marketer , rose $ 2 . 74 to close at $ 13 . 90 wednesday on the new york stock exchange . shares though are still down 69 percent since the company reported third quarter earnings just over two weeks ago . carol coale , an analyst with prudential securities inc . in houston , said wednesday ' s surge was likely a reaction to a the wall street journal report that enron ' s beaten - down stock price has stirred rumors of a possible takeover . others may be buying figuring the stock has hit bottom , she said . on tuesday , enron ' s stock closed at $ 11 . 16 , its lowest level since 1992 . enron shares began their steady fall in the middle of october , when the company reported a net loss of $ 638 million in the third quarter , taking a one - time charge of $ 1 . 01 billion attributed to investment losses , troubled assets and unit restructurings . some of these losses have been tied to partnerships managed by enron ' s former chief financial officer , andrew fastow , who was ousted last week . the potential conflict of interest has prompted an inquiry by the securities and exchange commission . earlier this week , moody ' s investors service downgraded the company ' s long - term debt and warned of possible further downgrades . potential buyers include general electric ' s ge capital unit , warren buffett ' s berkshire hathaway and royal dutch shell , the journal said . duane grubert , an analyst with sanford c . bernstein and co . in new york , said shell , which has a small presence in energy marketing , would be a good fit .

"" the issues impacting enron are pretty much specific to that company , "" said credit lyonnais securities analyst gordon howald . "" i don ' t believe that a lot of its peers have the same type of potential negative impact , "" he said . enron ' s widespread use of complex off - balance - sheet financing deals and its reluctance to disclose details about them are a key reason why investors have dumped the company ' s stock , causing it to fall more than 60 percent in the last two weeks . and while other natural gas and electricity marketers use similar techniques to avoid overloading their balance sheets with debt , nobody does so to the same extent as enron , analysts said . "" enron is a unique case in the magnitude of off - balance sheet transactions , "" said prudential securities analyst carole coale . uncomfortable with disclosure coale said she was not comfortable with the level of disclosure provided by many of enron ' s peers about such deals , but she said this was less of a problem at other companies because they have less exposure to the risky energy trading and marketing business which contributes about 80 percent of enron ' s profits . el paso corp . , for example is channeling over $ 1 billion in off - balance - sheet financing into its project electron venture which was set up to acquire and manage power plants . analysts say they are reasonably pleased with the information that el paso has provided to them about electron . el paso ' s stock has fallen a relatively modest 5 percent over the last two weeks and analysts attribute this in large part to the fact that marketing and trading operations generate only about one quarter of the company ' s earnings . dynegy ' s stock is down some 17 percent over the last two weeks and analysts said this was linked to dynegy ' s assumption of a leadership role among u . s . energy marketers in many investors ' eyes as enron began to fall out of favor and as dynegy attained a correspondingly high price - earnings ratio . asked about dynegy ' s use of off - balance - sheet financing , spokesman john sousa drew a contrast between his own company and enron , saying dynegy had no financing that was backed by issuance of stock , nor any "" related party transactions "" . former high - fliers shunned analysts said that in the current uncertain investment climate , investors are shunning trading - oriented companies ' whose stocks had previously commanded high price - earnings multiples and seeking out more modestly valued companies which own physical assets such as power plants and natural gas pipelines . in terms of recent stock price performance this trend has punished a marketer - trader like aquila , whose shares are down 27 percent over the last two weeks . on the other hand it has been relatively kind to companies such as williams cos . and duke energy corp . , which until recently were treated with scorn by enron executives who aggressively propounded an "" asset - light "" philosophy . williams ' stock has fallen about 5 percent over the last fortnight while duke ' s shares are down less than 1 percent and have outperformed the broader u . s . stock market . j . p . morgan analyst anatol feygin said enron had fallen victim to its unique taste for sophisticated financing techniques and its failure to explain them when doubts started to surface . "" enron took it to an extreme in terms of financial engineering , but it didn ' t disclose enough information about what is behind all of these structures , "" he said . credit lyonnais securities ' howald had a simpler explanation , saying that as the euphoria which surrounded enron last year subsided , people began to see enron for what it was .

services company , made similar references in their third - quarter releases . none of the companies really showed people what they were telling them . ibm , general electric and citigroup are among 19 members of the dow jones industrial average whose most recent quarterly releases didn ' t include balance sheets . the evidence will come only when the companies submit their quarterly reports to the u . s . securities and exchange commission . balance sheets are required in the so - called 10 - q filings , along with the 10 - k filings that cover the full year . not much publicity by then , statistics about the companies ' assets , liabilities and shareholders ' equity , the accounting terms for what ' s owned , what ' s owed and what ' s left over , will be rather outdated . u . s . companies have 45 days from the end of a fiscal quarter to submit 10 - q reports , and 90 days from the end of a fiscal year for 10 - k reports . these filings usually don ' t arrive until weeks after the publication of earnings releases . so it ' s easy to overlook the additional information they provide , especially when it doesn ' t receive the kind of publicity that the earnings release does . yet the recent example of enron corp . - - another company that omits balance sheets from press releases - - provides evidence that investors who forgo the extra effort needed to find them do so at their own peril . enron , the largest energy trader , reported $ 1 . 01 billion in ` ` non - recurring ' ' costs in the third quarter from an expansion into water , telecommunications and retail - energy sales . the expense contributed to a $ 618 million loss for the quarter . these numbers were part of the houston - based company ' s income statement , a summary of sales , costs and expenses , and profits or losses during a specified time period . income statements are the cornerstone of any company ' s earnings release . billion - dollar numbers the release didn ' t even mention a larger figure that affected the balance sheet : a $ 1 . 2 billion drop in shareholders ' equity during the quarter resulting from the company ' s repurchase of 55 million shares from two partnerships , ljm cayman lp and ljm 2 co - investment lp , that helped finance projects . andrew fastow , who ran both partnerships , was ousted from his job as chief financial officer last week . chairman and ceo kenneth lay disclosed the repurchase in a subsequent conference call . such a one - two punch dealt a blow to investors ' fortunes . since oct . 17 , the day after the earnings release , enron ' s shares have fallen each day and have lost two - thirds of their value . the low of $ 10 . 90 yesterday was the lowest price since july 1992 . enron ' s third - quarter statement referred only to a loss on ` ` finance arrangements with a previously disclosed entity ' ' which contributed to $ 544 million of investment losses . the size of that item was later put at $ 35 million . the latter number amounts to just 3 . 5 percent of the overall figure for ` ` non - recurring ' ' costs , and less than 1 percent of the company ' s $ 47 . 6 billion in revenue for the quarter . growing debt burden the $ 1 . 2 billion figure is considerably larger not only in dollars , but also in percentage terms . enron had $ 11 . 74 billion of shareholders ' equity as of june 30 , according to the balance sheet in its second - quarter 10 - q filing . the reduction equaled more than 10 percent of that total . among other things , the balance sheet also shows that the company relied more heavily on debt financing during this year ' s first half . short - term debt , due in one year or less , doubled to $ 3 . 46 billion . long - term debt , maturing in more than one year , rose 9 . 4 percent to $ 9 . 36 billion . there ' s even more to the story of enron ' s indebtedness . the company guaranteed $ 3 . 3 billion in borrowing by osprey trust and marlin water trust , which bought some of its power plants . unless they pay off the debt by reselling the plants , the company may have to come up with the difference . nevertheless , any summary of a company ' s financial position provides a more complete picture than the income statement alone . this also holds true for companies whose finances are in better shape - - ibm , general electric and citigroup , to name three . knowing by showing other members of the dow industrials that wait until their filings to provide balance sheets are american express co . , at & t corp . , boeing co . , caterpillar inc . , coca -

' ' the new york - based company had more than $ 85 billion of ` ` total equity , ' ' weill said in the statement . general electric ' s release quoted chairman and ceo jeffrey immelt as saying ` ` our strong balance sheet , which gives us the flexibility to pursue strategic opportunities , ' ' is one of the fairfield , connecticut - based company ' s ` ` fundamental strengths .

> It'd be an MP3 player with solid state storage... instant on.Hmm. Seems like every CD player should include the
capability to rip, encode, and cache the last few CDs 
inserted. Playback would then never need to face seek delays... 
after the initial ripping, the only use of the laser 
pickup would be recognizing which CD is inserted --
which might be doable faster than a seek-and-start-at-
first-track operation.You could also take the CD out while it is ""playing"".Hmm. If the CD is still in the cache, maybe you don't
even have to insert it. Or choose it from a step-through
UI. Instead, you just wave it at an electronic eye of
some sort... and the player recognizes it from the 
silkscreening. Kids would like that. ""Play this,"" they'd
say, facing the CD at the player, and the player would
start immediately.- Gordon",Safe Email

Date: Not suppliedJakob Nielsen on Offshore Usability[1]: ""To save costs, some companies are 
outsourcing Web projects to countries with cheap labor. Unfortunately, these 
countries lack strong usability traditions and their developers have limited 
access -- if any -- to good usability data from the target users."" Offshore usability is a specific case of the general ""offshore design"" problem. 
Put simply, software teams are not successful when 
design or management are done in a different physical location than 
programming. Once I actually had a job where I was in New York, my direct 
manager was in Singapore, _his_ manager was in Hyderabad, and if I needed 
any management input I had literally no choice but to go to the CEO because at 
least he was awake during the same hours as I was. You can't get things done 
like this. A good project team relies on hundreds of small interactions a day. 
Here in the Fog Creek offices, we have 10 small conversations about FogBUGZ 3.0 
development every day. What I don't understand is people who think it's OK to move the developers ten 
time zones away from their managers and expect good results. Those same people 
would scream bloody murder if you told them that you were going to 
send the whole _management_ team to Bangalore or Beijing.[1] http://www.useit.com/alertbox/20020916.html

"rants about finding jobs, java vs C, what makes a good programmer, etc. Okay, hmm, I thought twice about this, but what the hey, jobs are hard to come by. There's a company hiring in Mountain View, looking for a few good hackers, no Java, no GUI, not even C++ -- just C and Linux and networking and good old stuff like that. They just raised a wad of money and they're looking for a few ""really good programmers"", says the CTO. I know him -- very smart guy. Drives too fast, though, for what that's worth.Joe Bob says ""check it out"". I'd be happy to pass on your resume, or you can send it straight to them.

It seems that several people are missing the point that this is NOT an image
database.  It is high-resolution topological data rendered in three
dimensions.  Images are overlayed on the topological data to help people
navigate familiar terrain visually.  In other words, it is not intended as a
wannabe spy satellite.  Rather it is a very accurate three dimensional model
of the earth's surface.  When a particular region in question is covered in
a city, the buildings in the city are mapped as though they are part of the
earth's surface.  The part that makes the app killer is that you can map all
sorts of data layers on top of their core topological data.Got it?-James Rogers

around to doing something about it... You can now add

and after apt-get update you can find out what's available with 
'apt-cache search ^task-'These are generated directly from comps.xml of RH8.0 so they contain 
exactly the same packages as you'll get by choosing the various categories 
at install time. I didn't bother including SRPMS for these as they are 
rather uninteresting, if you want you can re-generate the .specs by 
running http://koti.welho.com/pmatilai/comps2task/comps2task.py.BTW the repository only contains the task-packages, you'll need an

( i get a lot of requests for both of these types of fonts , and i see requests for information on the list , too . ) i am interested in ftp sites for obtaining public domain / shareware fonts , along with addresses , etc . of people or organizations that create fonts for sale ( the copyrighted fonts - - the ones you can ' t copy freely ) . i will compile a list of where to get the ftp fonts , and a separate section with a listing of who provides which copyrighted fonts , and how to obtain them . i will also download the fonts from ftp sites , and pass them on to whoever asks for them . one of the problems i encounter when i try to read the work of others , is the usage of different orthographies by different people . i would like to see a common ( within each language ) orthography for each of the languages we all study - - the smaller language groups quite often do n't have a common orthography . ( i do n't know if such a thing is even possible ; there may be too much disagreement on what a font for language _ _ _ _ _ should look like . we seem to disagree on just about every other topic , but that 's healthy , i think . ) if i could develop a repository for fonts , then , for example , i could write a paper about the cahuilla language and e-mail the paper anywhere in the world along with the font ( s ) necessary to read / print the paper . ( copyrighted fonts would have to be purchased from the source . ) others could do the same with "" their "" languages . often , when writing papers , and quoting the works of others , i need to write using a non-standard font , so i need to make it myself , then go back to my writing . i have n't counted them , but i have a bunch of partial fonts for many languages , both orthography and ipa . however , these partially completed fonts are based on books written as far back as the 1800s . i seriously doubt that they represent current writing systems . i do n't want to step on anybody 's toes , but i can develop a font for any language out there . i can do both truetype and postscript fonts for both the pc and macs . however , if somebody else has already done the work , it makes sense to use their fonts . why re-invent the wheel ? as far as naming the fonts i ' ve created , i ' ve been using the three-letter language codes from _ ethnologue : languages of the world _ , ed . barbara f . grimes , 12th ed . , 1992 . for example , my cahuilla orthography is c-chl . ttf ( truetype for pc ) , and my cahuilla ipa is c-chl - p . ttf . i recently responded to jan tent 's posting about yesterday , today , and tomorrow words . i sent her words in north american indian languages . she wrote back asking about some of the symbols i had used . if a common font set was available , i could have e-mailed her a font for her computer , and she could have read my reply with the native orthography and ipa pronunciations in the document i sent . to me , it seems that this would be useful to people . i 'd like to hear others ' opinions about such a project ( in addition to where to ftp or buy fonts ) . i would especially like to hear from the indigenous language speakers on this list , in addition to the linguists . so send me your information and opinions , even if the opinion is , "" chuck , you ' re an idiot . scrap the whole idea . "" i ' ll post a summary to the list if there 's enough interest , otherwise i ' ll respond personally . if you need a font for a language you ' re working on , let me know that , too . happy holidays , chuck coker work : ( 909 ) 882-2099 ( united states ) home : ( 909 ) 886-5035 ( united states ) e-mail : cjcoker @ csupomona . edu = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = there have been no dragons in my life , only small spiders and stepping in gum . i could have coped with the dragons . - - anonymous ( but wise )",Safe Email

Speech at TTI Vanguard: ""Designing for Resiliency"" 
Conference""911.net""by Bruce Sterling     Late last month I had the joy and privilege
of hanging out with a big crowd of American computer
scientists who were, basically, trying to find some 
reasons to live.    Despite all evidence to the contrary, they've
definitely got some reasons.    When you go to a conference which is very high-energy, 
with a lot of paradigmatic reassessment going on, where 
ideas are being flung around bodily well outside the box, 
well, that's an impressive thing.  But it's my principle 
as a sometime working journalist  not to get all carried 
away whenever I witness something like that.  They might 
well be drinking their own bathwater.  This sort of thing 
generally requires a reality check from some *other* 
conference.    So, I'm now fresh back from Colorado, from the yearly 
meeting of the High Ground Design Conversation.  These are 
my best pals in the industrial design world, some dear, 
long-time friends of mine, whose judgment I always trust.  
And why would a science fiction writer trust the judgment 
of industrial designers?  Well, because they're very 
*trendy.*  They're very shrewd,  and very stylish, and very 
hands-on people.  They're  peculiarly self-effacing and modest,
yet quite  imaginative.  Better yet, they're even practical.  
So they're kind of like science fiction writers, only with 
much better shoes.    Usually when I go to this High Ground event, I just 
deliver some wacko chat about popular aspects of 
cyberculture and then I take some worshipful notes.  But!  
I have to report that when I took them my notes from the 
""CRA Grand Challenges in Computation"" conference, I was 
bringing the noise.    This is the first time I have ever seen their jaws 
drop.  They're still kinda wringing their hands over the 
dotcom boom and the Ka-boom. They miss those glory days of 
the World Wide Web == because for them, that was the 
Graphic Designers Full Employment Act.  So they're pretty 
broke, and they're a little shell-shocked, so I guess they 
should join the club.  But  when I brought them *this* 
stuff == a rather extensively worked-out vision in 
worldbuilding from the point of view of ubiquitous 
computation in the 21st century...  Well, of course this 
is merely a scenario, but to me, ""911.net"" smells like the 
future.     And frankly, it doesn't smell good.  But that's all 
right.  Because these aren't good times.  These are rather 
harsh, dark times, and in its own peculiar way, 911.net is 
a similarly harsh, dark concept.    ""Ubiquitous computation"" is by no means a new idea.   
The guy who invented the term is dead, and even his R&D 
lab doesn't look all that great these days.  Ubicomp has 
been around for quite some time == in the table-napkin, 
handwaving stage.  But it's lacked the means, motive and 
opportunity to get any real-world traction.   I believe that may be changing.  If so, it's mostly due 
to the events of September 11.  After that experience, 
ubicomp has got motive and opportunity as it never had 
before.  And the means, although they are still 
speculative, are starting to make some sense.    What am I talking about when I use the term ""ubicomp""?  
Well, the term is a grab-bag, a congelation of different 
technologies.  Some are here, commercially available off 
the shelf; some are in the lab; and some may be physically 
impossible.    Let's get down to some brass virtual tacks.  What are 
the key technical drivers for widely distributed, self-
organizing networks of sensors, processors and actuators, 
embedded in the physical world?  And what do you do with 
these things?    Okay, number one:  fuel cells.  Not chemical 
batteries.  Small, portable, dependable, long-lasting, 
power sources with some punch.  They may not be fuel cells 
as they are now known.  They might be MEMS fuel cells, or 
aluminum-air cells, or something enzymatic, I don't care; 
just something much, much better than today's batteries.  
Portable power is the crux.  Ubicomp's  future, if it has one,
entirely hinges on this.  If we don't get some seriously 
advanced,  portable sources of power then everything I am 
about to tell you is a sci-fi phantasm. (Not that there's 
anything wrong with that!)    Number two, RFID.  Radio-Frequency ID == gotta have 
some taggers.  Gotta be on the Net.  It'd be nice if they 
had some powered processors in them.  Something internal, 
pervasive, a little computational action that is going on 
inside physical objects.    Number three, wireless broadband.  Getting real close 
here.   Number four, dongles.  I think this part is seriously 
underappreciated.  This is the weird part of ubicomp, the 
part that may turn out to be its Achilles heel:  some way 
to turn the damn thing off.  And to *know* it's off.  The 
problem of the authorized user.  The authorized 
administrator, the authorized access.  This is likely to 
play out as ubicomp's functional equivalent of the 
Internet's intellectual-property problem.  In other words, 
it's a very serious issue which is going to be neglected 
from the get-go, as people are eagerly building the basic 
infrastructure.  Then, as they lamely try to build it in 
later, they are going to find out that they have 
inadvertently poisoned the water-stream for everybody.    You don't want to wander into a Kazaa and Napster 
version of George Orwell.  Ubiquitous computation, unlike 
information, does not ""want to be free.""  This is not a 
technology of freedom. Ubiquitous computation wants to 
make you its slave. Try to remember that, for all our 
sakes, all right?  This is not a water-cooler for gossip, 
like the Internet is.  This is a hard-case, hard-times, 
hands-on, rather ruthless command-and-control system.    Number five, GPS, global positioning systems.  Been 
there, done that.    Number six, convoy traffic.  I think this is also 
underestimated, for when I started looking at serious 
applications for ubicomp, time and again, rapidly shipping 
large amounts of physical material in and out of the 
ubicomp zone is a killer application.  Getting stuff in, 
numbering it, assembling it, moving it out. Lots of it. 
Train loads, truck loads, bus loads. And airlifts.    Bringing up the van, a whole bunch of other ubi-stuff, 
of varying degrees of use and practicality.  High speed 
fiber optic networks, check.  Massive storage and routers, 
check.  Big databases, check, but they need to be fast and 
flexible. Some ""MobiHoc"" action: mobile ad-hoc self-
assembling networks: networks that are always 
reconfiguring in real-time, always on the move.      Facial recognition has a considerable number of 
ubicomp applications, by no means all of them good.  Human 
presence-sensing systems?  Oh yes.  Ruggedized hardware 
suitable for outdoor deployment in all conditions and 
weathers.  Real-time simulation of ongoing major 
situations.  Toxin detectors of various kinds, 
environmental monitoring of almost every sort, biometric 
ID...  I have a long list of these.  I'm cross-checking 
them.  I'm using them to build scenarios.    One thing about 911.net makes it very distinct from 
earlier visions of ubicomp.  This is not Microsoft Windows 
for Housekeeping.  This is a hard, tough web that you 
throw down fast over dire emergencies.  The key concept 
here is that we are finally moving computation out of the 
ivory tower, for good and all.  No more glass boxes of the 
1950s, no more clean abstractions of cyberspace.  We are 
deploying computation at unheard-of speed, into the 
darkest, dirtiest, most dangerous places in the world.    It is a resilient security apparatus for emergencies. 
That is 911.net.      Now, you might well argue that ubicomp is very 
invasive of privacy.  That's just what my industrial 
design pals said about it, immediately, and they were 
right.  It's been hard to find reasonable deployments for 
ubicomp in peacetime commerce and in private homes, 
because it is so Orwellian. However.  Under certain 
circumstances, other social circumstances do trump this 
issue.    For instance, when you are breathing your last under a 
pile of earthquake rubble, you don't really care much 
about privacy under your circumstances.  What you really 
want is  a smart bulldozer, a tourniquet, and some direct 
pressure against your open wounds.  And that is what 
911.net is about == or will be about, should it find its 
way out of the computer-science talking-shop and into 
daylight.       It is an emergency response system for the planet's 
open wounds.  And those wounds exist in plenty.  There are 
more of them all the time.    I rather doubt that the Orwellian version of ubicomp 
has much of a future.  That's a scenario that I have 
dubbed ""Terrorspace"", which is ubicomp in the context of 
airports and nuclear power sites.  If you've been in 
airports recently, I believe you are seeing a pretty apt, 
early version of Terrorspace.  At any random moment, you 
can have your possessions rifled through by strangers.  
Your shoes are scanned, and various small but vital 
objects in your pockets can be confiscated by semi-
educated security geeks.  They're either pathetically 
under-trained for the job (in which case you certainly 
feel no safer), or else they are intelligent and capable 
people (in which case you pity them and wish they had some 
other job, for the sake of general human happiness and the 
GNP).  Rather than making us any safer, Terrorspace 
airports serve as political indoctrination centers that 
humiliate our voting population on a broad scale. They are 
meant to inure us to ever-escalating levels of 
governmental clumsiness and general harm.    The difficulty with this Terrorspace approach is that 
airports and airlines are going broke.  Airports are 
hemorrhaging money trying to maintain this terrorspace 
apparatus.  It is likely to spread to the brittle power of 
nuclear power plants, nuclear waste dumps, bio-sites, 
chemical sites, liquid petroleum gas centers and so forth. 
That will hugely increase the overhead of all these 
dangerous industries.     That's a very considerable tax burden.  So, though 
Terrorspace may serve as a full employment program for the 
loyal and slightly stupid, that's not going to pay off 
socially or economically in the long run.   However, 911.net is a different matter.   An air-
deployable 911.net that allowed first responders to 
rapidly deal with fires, floods and other major disasters 
would *save* money, especially for the insurers, who are 
already on the ropes.    The actual September 11 event, 9/11, was a rare and 
remarkable thing.  And, with fewer than 3,000 people dead, 
it's just not that big a deal as genuine catastrophes go.  
Politically, theologically and militarily it was huge, but 
a workaday 911.net wouldn't fret much about terrorism.  
Instead, it would have to deal mostly with floods, fires, 
climate change, earthquakes, volcanoes and (let's hope 
never) asteroids and weapons of mass destruction.   So, basically, with 911.net, we are describing a social 
re-definition of computer geeks as firemen.  Native 
twenty-first century computer geeks as muscular, with-it, 
first-responder types.  I think this would be pretty good 
for the computer industry.  We all need to take the 
dysfunctional physical world far more seriously.  This 
week, Italy's flooding, Texas is flooding, Colorado's on 
fire.  This morning, the brand-new wilderness forests 
around the site of the former Chernobyl are on fire, 
spewing radioactive ash hither and yon.   Chunks of 
Antarctica the size of Rhode Island have fallen into the 
sea. I could go on.    This is the sort of activity that humanity is required 
to deal with in this new century. If we build a successful 
method with which to do this, those useful tactics will 
spread across the fabric of our civilization.  I believe 
they are already spreading.  An innovation like 911.net 
will likely serve as a camel's nose in the tent for a 
whole series of ubicomp applications across society.    I've been speculating about these new forms of 
ubicomp, and giving them some flashy neologisms, because 
that is what science fiction writers bring to the table.  
We build little scenario worlds and make up names for 
them.  First we've got ""911.net,"" then ""Terrorspace,"" but 
there are others.BATTLESPACE.  A term already much-used by the Pentagon.  
Battlespace means military C4ISR. The ""Revolution in 
Military Affairs.""  I would point out that the military, 
unlike some sectors, is not reneging on their enthusiastic 
commitment to the digital revolution.  On the contrary.  I 
haven't seen anybody in the military saying that they long 
to go back to the good-old-fashioned, solid, easy-to-
understand methods of the War in Vietnam.  The military 
are very into ""network-centric warfare,"" and they couldn't 
be happier about their spysats and surveillance drones.PROSTHETIC UBICOMP.  This is eldercare.  A huge, steadily 
growing market. Alzheimer's disease is a flat-out domestic 
catastrophe that lasts seven years.  Any computational 
help here == in elder-proofing spaces, tracking the sick 
and so forth == would be of huge benefit to society.CRADLE.NET.  Babies have no privacy.  Children have little 
privacy. Child-proofing a room against a crawling tot... 
if you've ever done this, you can realize how much use it 
might be to have this process automated.  Any two-year-old 
always wonders:  ""Why can't Mr Fork and Miss Wall Socket 
be friends?""  A real-time checklist, at the very least!  
And then we're faced with the interesting, large-scale 
prospects of ""K-12.net.""STREET.NET.  This would be traffic management and urban 
systems management.  Water networks, power networks,
subways, sidewalks and so forth.PUNISH.NET.  Two million people are in the American prison 
population.  They've got no privacy.  They've gotta be 
watched all the time.  They're basically crammed in iron 
cages now.INDUSTRIAL UBICOMP. Managing supply chains, industrial 
assembly and so forth.  This will eventually be the 
biggest application.SO/HO UBICOMP.  Ubicomp in the home, the home office and 
small office.  Some very interesting consumer uses here, 
but in the grand scheme of things, not that big a deal.SAFETYSPACE.  These would be military bases, U.N. safety 
zones, refugee camps, and disaster evacuation centers.  
It's fairly easy to imagine ubiquitous computation as a 
sinister ""gated community"" that walls off privileged areas 
under threat.  But we can also think of it as importing 
some human comfort, solidarity, mercy and safety into 
various benighted areas that are severely disturbed.  One 
can imagine a Gorazde UN safe zone version of this, new 
and improved of course: a black helicopter ghosts over in 
the dead of night, deploys a scattering of small drones, 
smart-mines and sensors, and suddenly the war just stops 
within these bounds of Safetyspace.  Rapine, looting, 
sacking, smashing and burning are  ruled out of existence 
through computer awareness.  The handiness of a technique 
like that for life in the 21st century... well, it might 
be a bit underestimated.And last, coming up with a bullet should the good times 
return in all their carefree glory:  UBITOPIA.  This I 
take to be ubicomp as an Urban Entertainment Destination.  
You go there for fun just because there is cool, wacky 
stuff embedded in the physical world, and it's behaving in 
a way that brings joy and hilarity and good spirits, like 
the funhouse mirror at a digital carnival.      When and if Ubitopia really hits, it will mean that 
humanity's basic relationship with our material goods has 
been radically redefined.  That is the apotheosis of 
ubiquitous computation. Just: material goods, and the way 
we deal with them, are different.  Different in character, 
different in quality.  Not recognizable by 20th century 
standards.     So. I have no idea if the Homeland Security 
department, or FEMA or DARPA or the NSF, are going to pony 
up any money for any of these notions.  That's not my 
lookout.  I'm a science fiction writer.  And ladies and 
gentlemen, with this material, I have struck platinum.  
This stuff is really hot.  This is a great, attractive, 
contemporary idea that is really new, really different, 
and really ominous.  The implications are huge and they 
spread across the board of society. I am going to be a 
very busy guy with this material.  If you want to help me, 
send some email.Thanks a lot for your attention.O=c=O O=c=O O=c=O

"possible temporary move of hpl to 1201 louisiana i finished the walk through of the 15 th floor space located at 1201 louisiana this afternoon . on the walk through with me were paul foust ( facilities ) , robert humlicek , jeffrey vincent and andrew hawthorn . i previously talked with deborah bubenko and vincent fox about this space . comments from the review are as follows : most of the floor is composed of offices with some large group areas ( conference rooms etc . ) included . the floor can accommodate up to 150 people . however , with this amount of people in the area , space will be very tight . almost all offices will need to hold at least two people . large offices will need to hold three or four . the larger areas will need to have cubicles installed to make complete use of the space . with maximum doubling up in the offices , you might fit a couple of conference rooms on the floor with one kitchen area . there are nooks just off some of the hallways that would accommodate several network printers . as tommy stated in his earlier e - mail on the allen center space , the fire code will require us to put a strobe in each office with multiple occupants . one area of concern is the amount of furniture currently on the floor . the floor plan shows approximately 90 desks on the floor . some offices were locked so we could not verify the total . however , this number appears correct . also , for the most part , there were only desks in the offices unless they were occupied . chairs , filing cabinets , credenzas , etc . would needed to be added to this space . we need to determine where the additional furniture will come from . there is one large area with 11 cubicles forming a circle . according to paul , this was the area where telephones were answered for the previous tenant . this might work for the trading area . the room appears to have the most telephone connectivity , is open , and would accommodate up to 11 . if we decide trader telephones are necessary ( record conversations etc . ) , the cost associated with the purchase of the equipment and the necessary installation time will need to be factored into our schedule . the floor has two data closets . at least one of the closets has 24 hour air conditioning according to vincent . this floor has the same server connectivity at the three allen center space . a 100 meg single mode fiber connection serves this space . robert has informed me that the floor currently has switches to support up to 200 ports . however , this does not mean that the drops to all offices are complete . probably some cabling will need to be added . it appears that the space can accommodate up to 150 users even with the extra ports needed for network printers , laptops , etc . however , if we need to accommodate more than 200 ports , additional switches can be added . in summary , the floor space at 1201 louisiana looks as good or better than the space that was being considered at three allen center . russell s . long enron net works , llc russell . long @ enron . com ( 713 ) 345 - 3754",Safe Email

"re : 3 . 396 chomsky citations i would like to second mark durie 's concerns with what he calls a "" pre-generative black hole in modern citation patterns "" . it seems a real problem to me that so many of the younger scholars trained in the chomskian school of linguistics are almost completely ignorant of any work done outside that school . on the other hand it seems those who do have a solid knowledge of the history of ideas in linguistics and have an awareness of typological diversity and have worked seriously with a number of languages tend to produce superior work . a prime example is the work of michael silverstein , whose work is grounded on a very thorough knowledge of the work of sapir , boas , saussure , bloomfield , etc . , as well as experience doing detailed work with american indian and australian languages , as well as a good knowledge of work done in the philosophy of language .",Safe Email

  | 
  | 7.3 seems to support Chinese input out of the box, it's got
  | miniChinput and some other stuff no documentation.  [ ... ]
  | google is a bit of a dead too.
  | 
  | Can anyone tell me what I should do? I've no idea, but a relevant/useful source of info could
 be the Â«linux-utf8Â» e-list:     http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/unicode.html
     http://mail.nl.linux.org/linux-utf8/ whilst the list is nominally about UTF-8/Unicode and Linux,
 it often delves into related areas (such as input methods). my (vague!) understanding of the state-of-play is there are
 multiple ways of keyboarding scripts such as ""Chinese"", and
 the choice of method is a mixture of personal preference,
 equipment (e.g. your keyboard), and the tool/application
 in question. w.r.t. X11 applications, it seems to boil down to two
 approaches:   one unique to the tool itself (apparently
 `yudit' is famous for this);  or  else using what's called
 an XIM (X Input Method).  WARNING: I am now guessing quite a bit here, based mostly on
           my interpretation of what I've read whilst lurking,
           and watching a few people keyboarding a Japanese
           script years ago!   *** your mileage will vary! *** XIMs generally work as a complex compose frontend.  i.e., you
 build up your character as a series of composes of the root or
 fundamental strokes (""radicals"", I think they are called), and
 then ""commit"" the composite character to the application.
 ( yes, keyboarding these scripts _is_ quite slow, I believe
  a good typist can only do a few characters a minute!
  and I assume using a qwerty keyboard is very painful. ) some XIMs compose ""in place"", others do it on a special line,
 and some seem to do it in a special window (or the root?).
 also, some(/most?) XIMs apparently support a US-ASCII input
 mode as well --- _not_ a general Latin-alphabet input mode,
 which seems to require another TLA, called KBD, and which
 apparently doesn't work when an XIM is also being used? ---
 implying you have to switch back and forth between US-ASCII
 input mode (what us English-speakers would call ""normal""
 keyboarding/typing), and the other input (e.g., Chinese).
 I'm not sure, but I have the impression the switch is often
 a toggle, and something like . many apologies if this is completely wrong or too misleading.cheers!
	-blf-p.s.  b.t.w., you almost certainly want to be using a UTF-8
      locale.  if RH 7.3 is the so-called ""limbo"" release,
      then you may quite possibility be using one by default.--

able to set the PROM to boot from whatever disk slice you'd want. No need 
to set that in lilo/grub any more in that case, since the OpenBoot rom 
takes care of that part for you. Then again, you wouldn't get a menu that 
allows you to choose what you want to boot. There's good and bad, all

"gene flow and indo - europeans h . m . hubey has made readers of this list aware of an interesting article which appeared in the june 24 , 1995 , issue of science news concerning evidence from dna data indicating a gene flow from anatolia into europe beginning around 9 , 000 years bp . hubey also points out that there is genetic evidence that nomads from the central eurasian yamna culture spread westward into europe approximately 5 , 500 years ago . while it is indeed reasonable to link the first migration with the spread of agriculture , it does not follow that those who migrated spoke any form of indo - european ( "" pre - "" , "" proto - "" , or dialects thereof ) . nor does it follow that "" [ i ] t is possible that both expansions were responsible for the spread of different subfamilies of indo - european languages . . . "" we know from cuneiform records that by 3 , 000 bce anatolia was populated ( at least in part , if not in full ) by people speaking caucasian languages . in eastern anatolia , hurrian and the later attested and closely-related urartean were spoken . these languages have been convincingly shown by sergej starostin and igor diakonoff to be related to northeast caucasian . in central anatolia , hattic was spoken - - this was later replaced by hittite , an indo - european language . diakonoff maintains that hattic was also a caucasian language . finally , diakonoff has claimed that the language spoken by the gutians ( qutians ) was a caucasian language . moreover , there are no unambiguous references to indo - european people or languages in written records from the ancient near east until just before 2 , 000 bce , and the first references are to hittites . it is generally agreed by specialists ( for example , gamkrelidze , mellaart , puhvel , steiner , among others ) that the hittites were invaders who imposed themselves upon populations speaking caucasian languages ( in particular , hattic ) . thus , there is much stronger evidence that prior to about 2 , 000 bce , anatolia was populated by speakers of caucasian languages than by speakers of indo - european languages . thus , it follows logically that if one were to attempt to correlate gene flow at about 9 , 000 bp from anatolia to europe with language spread that one would tend to think more about very early forms of caucasian rather than indo - european . allan r . bomhard boston , massachusetts",Safe Email

This may be a little off topic but thought people here would have a better
response to this elsewhere.I have setup two MX records (mail and bmail) for my mail server. The one I
gave a 10 (bmail) the other a 20 (mail).bmail(10) I gave a 10 because I want all mail to go through this server to
be scanned for SPAM and viruses and then relayed to the mail(20) server for
delivery.As I understand it, DNS A records are used in a rotating fashion for load
balancing, but DNS MX records are used in order or prority, meaning the 10
before the 20 and only 20 if the 10 isn't available.But only some of the mail is actually being scanned which leads me to
believe that not all of the mail is actually hitting that box and the 10
never goes down. Why? Have I got something confused here?Thanks,

Date: 2002-09-23T23:21:12-06:00Finally finished up (most of) TRAMP, my RDF interface for Python. (If you don't 
use RDF or Python you can probably safely skip this entry.)  New in this version: RDF library abstraction (because rdflib's organization 
currently sucks), write values in addition to reading, and unit tests, all with 
that old TRAMP flavor you've come to know and love.  _But wait,_ it also comes with an entire page of explanation/advertisement[1] 
if you're not already convinced.    RDF/XML got you down? Tired of having to go through contortions to deal 
    with data? Want to write Python and be standards-compatible at the same 
    time? Need a module to implement the psuedo-code you had on your slides? *
    TRAMP may or may not be the answer to these problems!*Enjoy, and get a free bonus prize if you can tell me[2] why it's called TRAMP.[1] http://www.aaronsw.com/2002/tramp

"One of the main strands of this 'modernisation' is to have all stations on a 'retained' basis at night. Basically this means that the fire station will be unmanned and in the event of a fire, the fire-fighters will be summonsed by pagers, the same way that they currently are in a lot of rural regions. The main reason for this is that fewer fires occur at night. However, the majority of fatalities in fires do occur at night and the recent deaths during the fire-fighters' strike all occurred at night. Over half of these happened in areas currently covered by retained crews who aren't on strike and would appear to give a grim foreshadowing of what may be to come. Currently one of the conditions for being in a retained crew is that you must live/work within one mile of the station. How they will apply this to whole time fire-fighters is still unclear. A good friend of mine is a station officer in Hampshire and currently lives 20 miles from his station so how he'll respond to fire calls at night is a mystery.  And I can't see many fire-fighters living within a mile of some of the inner London stations.DaveTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:

"summary : c - insertion some weeks ago i posted a query as to whether anyone knew examples of consonant insertion to separate impermissible vowel clusters , in which the choice of consonant was not conditioned by its surrounding vowels . thanks who all those who responded . their names and e-mail addresses appear with their edited remarks . i would welcome further comments on anything brought up in this summary . reason for the query : my query was prompted by work i ' ve been doing on the czech verb system in which , in certain forms from certain paradigms , a glide / j / appears that is not present in other forms . ( since most e-mail won't support czech diacritics , i ' ll spell all czech forms phonetically . an apostrophe after a consonant indicates its palatalization . ) typical of such verbs is the verb [ d ' elat ] "" to do "" : [ d ' ela : ] "" he / she / it does "" [ d ' elaji : ] "" they do "" [ d ' elaji : c ] active participle ( plural ) in old church slavonic and in russian , this / j / appears in all persons of the present tense in related paradigms ( e . g . , russian [ d ' elajet ] "" to do "" 3rd per . sing . ) and creates a vjv sequence , which historically contracted into a long vowel in czech ( e . g . , [ d ' ela : ] ) . in most current phonological accounts of west slavic languages , such as rubach ( 1993 ) , this / j / is considered to be present underlyingly , but then needs to be deleted in almost all forms of these verbs . this representation seemed too abstract to me , and when i considered czech phonotactic restrictions ( see charts in palkova ( 1994 ) ) from an autosegmental viewpoint , it occurred to me that the / j / ( where it does survive ) may simply be inserted to break up impermissible v clusters or to prevent formation of overlong syllable nuclei . the only sticking point in this was that / j / often appears between non-high vs or vs with which it shares no obvious features . as i found out from the responses and from searching i ' ve done since , the epenthesis of consonants between non-homorganic vowels is not as uncommon as one might assume . so far , the norm seems to be that cs inserted at morpheme boundaries will be glides ( even between non-high vs ) unless there is a relic consonant that has been retained , and sometimes analogically extended , in a given environment . in all cases i ' ve found where the inserted c is a relic , that c is coronal . more data would be greatly welcome . the responses : albert ortmann ( ortmann @ sapir . ling . uni-duesseldorf . de ) mentioned several examples : english intrusive / r / , french t-epenthesis in interrogative forms , dutch insertion of / j / and / v / between non-high vs morpheme internally ( e . g . , theater [ te : ' ( j ) a : t @ r ] ; zovals [ zo : ' ( v ) als ] "" like , as if "" ) , and swiss german insertion of / n / between certain hosts and clitics ( e . g . groesser wie-n - i "" taller than - ep - i "" ) . = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = subj : vowel clusters from : spscob @ main . queen-margaret - college . ac . uk from : spscob @ main . queen-margaret - college . ac . uk x - from : spscob @ main . queen-margaret - college . ac . uk ( dr james m scobbie ) some people might think that / r / sandhi in english is of the type you are looking for , but really / r / is just the consonantal glide counterpart of non-high vowels , so it 's just like finding / j / near / i / or / w / near / u / . note , however , that to avoid inserting / r / in certain socially stigmatised environments , many speakers insert glottal stop : law [ ? ] and order instead of law [ r ] and order = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = subj : c - insertion from : seegmiller @ apollo . montclair . edu ( steve seegmiller ) karachay , a turkic language , has a clear case of a consonant appearing under certain circumstances involving what would otherwise be v - v sequences . the plural suffix is - le or - la ( depending on vowel harmony ) , so that at ' horse ' has the plural atla . however , if the plural suffix is itself followed by another suffix beginning with a vowel , an - r - appears : atlari "" m ' my horses ' . ( the 1sg possessive suffix is - im / i "" m / um / u "" m ) . the - r - is clearly historical , since the karachay forms with - r - are similar to the ordinary turkish form . that is , the turkish forms corresponding to the karachay ones given above are at , atlar , atlari "" m . the thing i do n't know is whether there is motivation for postulating this - r - in the underlying form of the plural suffix or not . there are some reasons to say yes and some to say no , so i ' m not sure . = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = from : gladney @ vmd . cso . uiuc . edu i do n't have references , but here are three e examples i have noticed : freebie , sukie ( a diminutive of sue ) , and the l . a . lakers . best wishes , frank y . gladney . = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = from : karlrein @ aol . com subj : intrusive glides i do n't know if this is what you are looking for , but portuguese has [ y ] s and [ w ] s that come between more open final and initial vowels . in some dialects ( continental and insular ) ' na agua ' is [ n ( schwa ) + y + agwa ] . when nasal vowels are on both sides , the [ y ] is nasal . in many varieties ( all ? ) ' no ano ' is [ nu + w + ( mid-central a ) nu ] . sorry about the lack of symbols . karl reinhardt , dept . of modern and classical languages , university of houston . = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = from : ferry @ cimrs1 . mnhn . fr to : jpkirchner @ aol . com for glide insertion in eskimo language you can see : jorgen rischel , topics in west greenlandic phonology , akademisk forlag , copenhagen , 1974 . insertion of nasal velar or nasal uvular to prevent the fusion of two long vowels . best regards philippe mennecier , muse ' e de l ' homme , paris = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = subj : consonant insertion picard @ vax2 . concordia . ca ( marc picard ) i think you ' ll probably find find that most cases of consonant insertionare the result of analogy . in french , for example , what should be chante-il ' is he singing ' is actually chante - t-il , the epenthetic / t / having been introduced in all first conjugation verbs through the influence of a final 3 sg final / t / in the other conjugations , e . g . finit-il , fait-il , recoit-il , etc . also , because of final consonant deletion , words like abri 's helter ' and debit came to have an identical ending . however , because so many such forms alternated with morphologically complex words ending in / t / , some original vowel-final words acquired this consonant in composition so that , for example , abriter came to replace abrier ( which is still used in canadian french in the sense of ' to cover ' ) . you ' ll also find cases like clou ' nail ' with derived forms either with or without / t / , e . g . clouer ' to nail ' vs . cloute , clouterie , cloutier . although / t / is the 'd efault ' consonant , as it were , you ' ll also find cases like joli , jolie ' pretty ' yielding enjoliver ' to embellish ' ;

if the final syllable of the stem is heavy ( that is , if it ends with a long vowel or a diphthong ) , then - aa is suffixed , an epenthetic [ w ] being added . the infinitives ashakataa / a = shaka-ta - aa / ( 0 = get . off - tt-inf ) "" to get off "" y cheecheewaa / cheechee-aa / ( soft - inf ) "" to be soft "" illustrate this contrast . = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = thanks again to all who responded . i 'd welcome more examples if anyone knows of any . james kirchner jpkirchner @ aol . com",Safe Email

But to be fair, I appreciate the pipline idea; just as it's useful on the commandline, it'll be emensely powerful for manipulating multimedia, too.    It's just not EASY yet.  I'm sure all kindsa glade-produced front-ends will come up for it soon, though.  And the docs are complete, too...

the blackouts is to reregulate.  Ultimately we have to blame the people
who crafted the game rules in a way that invited blackouts and
exploitation.  Given that the particular set of rules crafted by the state
of California sucked, does there exist a set of rules that doesn't suck?  
If there does exist a better set of rules, then reregulation isn't
necessarily the answer.You can't blame businesses for being profit maximizers.  Yes, the people 
involved were heartless and corrupt.  But mainly they just did their

"kitahara review . hisatsugu kitahara , ( 1997 ) elementary operations and optimal derivations , mit press , cambridge , mass . 140 pages , $ 15 . 00 . reviewed by julie legate , < jlegate @ mit . edu > this book is very firmly situated within the minimalist approach to syntactic theory that was begun by chomsky ( 1991 ) and perhaps most fully articulated in chomsky ( 1995 ) . it adopts much of the basic architecture of the 1995 version of minimalism ( henceforth mp ) , while deriving several of its principles and assumptions . the first three chapters of the book propose some comparatively minor alterations to the mp system , and demonstrate that these alterations allow several stipulations of the mp to be dropped , while retaining or improving the framework 's empirical coverage . the final chapter retains the proposals of the previous chapters while putting forth a new condition that is a more clear departure from the mp approach . with this condition , kitahara is able to account for several notoriously problematic wh-constructions . kitahara 's first chapter consists of a review of the minimalist syntactic framework . he discusses the conceptual foundation of the approach ( the unflinching application of occam 's razor to every aspect of the computational system ) , the guiding principles of global economy , as well as the internal mechanisms of the computation ( including the creation of syntactic trees through successive operations of merge and of morphological feature-driven move ) . his second chapter contains the core proposals of the book . kitahara replaces the operations of merge , move , and erase by two "" elementary operations "" : "" concatenation "" and "" replacement "" . concatenation is the procedure which joins two objects alpha and beta to form a new object k . replacement , on the other hand , substitutes an object alpha for an object beta , where beta is contained within a larger object sigma . the mp operations are redefined using these elementary operations as follows ( p35 ) : ( i ) cyclic merge = concatenation cyclic move = concatenation noncyclic merge = concatenation + replacement noncyclic move = concatenation + replacement erase = replacement he further redefines the shortest derivation condition ( chomsky 1991 , 1993 ; epstein 1992 ) in terms of these operations , as in ( ii ) ( p26 ) : ( ii ) shortest derivation condition ( sdc ) minimize the number of elementary operations necessary for convergence . given this technology , he proceeds to derive several of the principles and assumptions of mp . first , he considers cyclicity , providing a detailed summary and comparison of the approaches taken in chomsky 1993 , 1994 , and 1995 . he derives that , in simple cases , cyclic convergent derivations should be preferred over noncyclic convergent ones , since cyclic operations yield a shorter derivation . as shown in ( i ) above , cyclic operations involve only one elementary operation : concatenation , whereas noncyclic ones require two : concatenation and replacement . next , he turns to the mp principle of procrastinate : covert movement ( i . e . movement which occurs in the computation after the derivation is sent to pf for pronunciation ) is preferable to overt movement . he separates the discussion into head movement , object shift , and expletive insertion . he adopts the mp assumptions that ( a ) movement results in two instances of identical elements , one in the merged position and the other in the moved position ( i . e . the copy theory of movement ) ; ( b ) if an element is overtly attracted , the entire category moves , whereas if an element is covertly attracted , only the formal features move ; and ( c ) only one of the identical elements created by movement is interpreted at lf . finally , he proposes a novel interpretation of effect of strong features in the grammar , as in ( iii ) ( p37 ) : ( iii ) strong feature condition spell - out applies to sigma only if sigma contains no category with a strong feature . regarding head movement , in languages with overt verb raising , t has a strong v feature and thus overt raising is necessary for convergence . in languages without overt verb raising , the sdc selects derivations with covert , rather than overt , verb raising . although both covert and overt head movement involve one operation of replacement ( since head movement is necessarily non-cyclic ) , kitahara claims that overt head movement , being category movement requires an additional instance of replacement , thus resulting in a longer derivation . his reasoning is as follows . if a verb moves overtly , its semantic features are carried along . therefore , at lf it will be necessary to delete one of the instances of the semantic features , since elements are only interpreted once . this requires an application of replacement that is not needed for covert movement , since covert movement only affects the formal features , not the semantic features as well . notice that the same reasoning will not extend to phrasal movement . overt movement will require one instance of replacement to delete the semantic features of one member of the chain ( just considering a simple two-membered chain ) , however covert movement will also require one instance of replacement , since covert movement is necessarily non-cyclic . thus , the sdc cannot choose between derivations with overt object shift and those without . this predicts the optionality of object shift in languages like icelandic , without resorting to the mp ' optional strong feature ' analysis , which is a simple restatement of the facts . in languages without overt verb movement , object shift is predicted to be impossible , assuming that the object shifts to the outside specifier of vp , the inside specifier being the merged position of the subject , and that multiple specifiers are not equidistant from a higher head , unless head movement renders them equidistant . thus , the shifted object would block movement of the subject to tp , unless the verb has raised to t . kitahara acknowledges ( p144 , fn26 ) , however , that he cannot explain languages like french , that display overt verb raising but prohibit object shift . finally , kitahara considers the timing of expletive insertion . notice that although mp assumes that merge is cheaper than move , kitahara 's reanalysis predicts that merge be equally economical to cyclic move , since both consist of one application of concatenation . since the timing of expletive insertion is the primary empirical motivation for the mp assumption , kitahara demonstrates that this timing is equally captured within his system . consider the familiar sentences ( iv ) and ( v ) . ( iv ) there seems to be a man in the room . ( v ) * there seems a man to be in the room . in ( iv ) , the expletive was inserted in the embedded [ spec , t ] and raised to the matrix tp . in ( v ) , on the other hand , "" a man "" was raised to the embedded tp and the expletive was inserted directly into the specifier of the matrix tp . mp claimed that ( iv ) is preferred over ( v ) because it is cheaper to merge the expletive into the embedded tp than to move the associate . kitahara claims that these facts follow from his sdc . since expletives are assumed to have no semantic features , overt raising of "" there "" will not require an application of replacement to delete an instance of semantic features in ( iv ) . in ( v ) , on the other hand , overt raising of "" a man "" will require replacement to delete one of the resulting two instances of the semantic features of "" a man "" . therefore , the derivation in ( iv ) is shorter than that in ( v ) and thus preferred . as a side point , notice that this analysis requires that the formal features of "" a man "" raise covertly directly to the matrix t . if these features raised to the embedded tp covertly , the non-cyclic movement would result in an additional application of replacement , and ( iv ) and ( v ) should be equally economical ( an equivalent situation to object shift ) . kitahara concludes chapter two with a note about the timing of expletive insertion in icelandic transitive expletive constructions . he assumes the mp analysis that the associate ( i . e . the subject of the transitive ) moves into the inner specifier of tp and the expletive merges into the outer specifier of tp , the verb appearing between the two as a verb-second phenomenon . he notes that although this situation is the opposite of the english situation discussed above , i . e . here category movement precedes expletive insertion , this is predicted by the restriction against downwards movement . assuming the associate must move to adjoin to the expletive at lf , the associate must appear lower than the expletive , in order for this movement to be raising rather than lowering . in chapter three , kitahara demonstrates that chomsky 's ( 1995 ) minimal link condition can explain phenomena which had previously received disparate analyses in the literature . ( vi ) minimal link condition ( mlc ) h ( k ) attracts alpha only if there is no beta , beta closer to h ( k ) than alpha , such that h ( k ) attracts beta . kitahara begins with relativized minimality ( chomsky 1993 ) violations , as in ( vii ) , and superiority condition violations , as in ( viii ) . ( vii ) * john seems it is t ( john ) certain to be here . ( viii ) * what did you persuade whom to buy t ( what ) ? the mlc accounts naturally for these facts : in ( vii ) , "" it "" is closer than "" john "" to the matrix t , and thus blocks attraction of "" john "" ; in ( viii ) , "" whom "" is closer to the matrix cp than "" what "" and thus blocks attraction of "" what "" . next , kitahara considers proper binding condition violations , like that shown in ( x ) . ( ix ) proper binding condition traces must be bound . ( x ) * which picture of t ( who ) do you wonder who john likes t ( which picture of t ( who ) ) ? he argues that a proper binding condition analysis of ( x ) is no longer available in minimalist approaches . this condition can no longer apply at s - structure , since s - structure has been eliminated from the model , and lf reconstruction of "" picture of t ( who ) "" could create a configuration in which the trace of "" who "" is bound . instead , kitahara offers an mlc solution . he observes that ( x ) involves two violations of the minimal link condition . first , "" which "" is closer to the embedded cp than "" who "" and thus blocks the attraction of "" who "" ( note that "" picture of who "" would be necessarily carried along with "" which "" to the embedded cp by an independent convergence condition ) . second , given the illegitimate attraction of "" who "" to the embedded cp , "" who "" becomes closer to the matrix cp than "" which "" , and thus blocks the attraction of "" which "" . assuming that ( xi ) a derivation employing a greater number of illegitimate steps induces a greater degree of deviance ( p72 ) the derivation in ( xii ) below is preferred over ( x ) because ( x ) involves two violations of the mlc whereas ( xii ) involves only one . ( xii ) ? ? who do you wonder which picture of t ( who ) john likes t ( which picture of who ) ? kitahara extends this analysis to crossing versus nesting dependency data . ( xiii ) nested dependency condition ( pesetsky 1987 ) if two "" wh "" - trace dependencies overlap , one must contain the other . the paradigm cases are those in ( xiv ) and ( xv ) : ( xiv ) ? ? what did you wonder whom john persuaded t ( whom ) to buy t ( what ) ? ( xv ) ? * whom did you wonder what john persuaded t ( whom ) to buy t ( what ) ? in ( xiv ) , kitahara observes , the mlc is disobeyed once , in the raising of "" what "" over "" whom "" to the matrix cp . in ( xv ) , on the other hand , the mlc is disobeyed twice , once in the raising "" what "" over "" whom "" to the embedded cp , and a second time in the raising of "" whom "" over "" what "" to the matrix cp . thus , following ( ix ) , the grammar prefers ( xiv ) over ( xv ) . finally , kitahara considers scrambling and topicalization in german and japanese , demonstrating that certain restrictions on these phenomena can also receive an mlc treatment . he assumes that both phenomena are feature driven , and that the scrambling / topicalization feature of the attracted element is interpretable , and thus remains accessible to the computation after checking . the basic pattern considered is that it is not possible to scramble an element from a constituent and then scramble the remnant , however it is possible to then topicalize the remnant . german examples are provided in ( xvi ) and ( xvii ) : ( xvi ) scrambling + scrambling of remnant * dass [ t ( das buch ) zu lesen ] keiner [ das buch ] t ( t ( das buch ) zu lesen ) that ( the book ) to read no one the book ( the book to read ) versucht hat tried has "" that no one has tried to read the book "" ( xvii ) scrambling + topicalization of remnant [ t ( das buch ) zu lesen ] hat keiner [ das buch ] t ( t ( das buch ) zu lesen ) ( the book ) to read has no one the book ( the book to read ) versucht tried "" no one has tried to read the book "" under these assumptions , ( xvi ) violates the mlc twice , first by scrambling the dp "" that book "" over the closer vp "" that book to read "" , and second by scrambling the vp "" t ( that book ) to read "" over the now-closer dp "" that book "" . ( xvii ) , on the other hand , does not violate the mlc at all . assuming that the features that drive topicalization and scrambling are distinct , "" that book "" would be the closest available element with the scrambling feature to the attracting head , since "" that book to read "" would have a topicalization feature rather than a scrambling feature . similarly , the vp "" t ( that book ) to read "" is the closest available element to be attracted for topicalization , since "" that book "" has a scrambling feature not a topicalization feature . in chapter four , kitahara discusses the differences in deviance between derivations which involve one violation of the mlc by a wh-element . he provides the generalization in ( xviii ) , and examples in ( xix ) - ( xxii ) ( p83 - 85 ) : ( xviii ) an mlc violation involving adjuncts , subjects , or quasi objects [ i . e . "" how many "" phrases ] is far more severe than an mlc violation involving objects . ( xix ) adjunct * how do you wonder [ whether john fixed the car t ( how ) ? ( xx ) subject * what do you wonder [ whether t ( what ) was fixed t ( what ) ] ? ( xxii ) quasi - object * how many pounds do you wonder [ whether john weighed t ( how many ) ] ? ( xxii ) object ? ? what do you wonder [ whether john fixed t ( what ) ] ? in order to explain this phenomenon , kitahara proposes the following condition ( p90 ) : ( xxiii ) chain formation condition an application of move forms 1 or > 1 chain ( s ) only if it is legitimate ( = violation-free ) and assumes that traces may be attracted ( at least covertly ) . he claims that the illegitimate wh-movements in ( xix ) - ( xxii ) do not form a chain . therefore , the wh-elements will not be able to be interpreted at lf , causing the derivation to crash . this accounts for the ungrammaticality of ( xix ) - ( xxii ) . in ( xxii ) , however , kitahara claims that the formal features of the trace of "" what "" raise covertly to check accusative case , and that it is this movement that saves the derivation . ( notice that covert movement of the traces of the wh-elements in ( xxiv ) - ( xxvi ) will not occur . adjuncts and quasi objects do not check case , and subjects move overtly to check case . ) according to the chain formation condition , the movement of the formal features of the object , being legitimate , may form one or more chains ; in particular , it forms a chain between the raised position of "" what "" in the matrix cp and the merged position of "" what "" . thus , the derivation can be interpreted at lf , and has only the status of a mlc violation . kitahara extends the analysis to ( xxiv ) . ( xxiv ) "" where "" / "" when "" adjuncts ? ? where / when do you wonder [ whether john fixed the car t ( where / when ) ? he assumes that these adjuncts are the complement of a null preposition . therefore , the formal features of the trace of "" where "" / "" when "" must raise covertly to check case with the null preposition , again creating the necessary chain between the moved position of "" where "" / "" when "" in the matrix cp and its merged position . this chapter concludes the book . although this book stands solidly on the foundations of previous minimalist syntactic research , it remains accessible to those who are not well-versed in minimalist theory . it provides very clear explanations of the details of previous minimalist approaches , as well as kitahara 's own proposals . furthermore , all relevant derivations are presented step-by - step , at a pace designed to accommodate the non-specialist . thus , it presents a good opportunity for those interested to learn about research and issues in minimalist syntax . those who are familiar with minimalist research should find this to be an interesting reworking and application of 1995 - style minimalism . anyone convinced by recent discussions of computational complexity and local economy ( see collins 1997 , johnson & lappin 1997 , yang 1997 , among others ) , however , will be dissatisfied with the approach , as it continues to rely on global economy conditions . since , of course , not everyone has been convinced by the discussion , this is more a note to prospective readers than a criticism . on a similar note , a crucial assumption for the analyses is that the grammar can count , which is controversial , but not obviously false . note that , regarding cyclicity , the notoriously problematic case of head - movement , which chomsky ( 1995 ) managed to incorporate into "" cyclicity "" requirements ( forcing it to apply before introduction of another head into the derivation ) , again falls outside the analysis of "" cyclicity "" . since all head - movement will require an operation of replacement , there is no longer any clear way to force it to apply before another head is introduced . perhaps more serious is the reformulation of the strong feature condition . the various strong feature conditions of previous minimalist approaches are simplified in the first chapter to ( ii ) above , repeated in ( xxv ) below . ( xxv ) strong feature condition spell - out applies to sigma only if sigma contains no category with a strong feature . the difficulty with this formulation is that it renders the strong feature condition an s - structure condition and thus anti - minimalist , since minimalism took great pains to eliminate all s - structure conditions . notice that it would be trivial to reformulate all previous s - structure conditions in a manner parallel to ( xxv ) - - "" spell - out applies to sigma only if sigma contains no traces which are not bound "" - - thus reducing the minimalist claim that s - structure is redundant to a matter of terminology only . furthermore , in the last chapter , a further condition involving strong features had to be introduced in order to rule out certain noncyclic derivations . this additional condition , given in ( xxvi ) , is essentially a weakened version of chomsky 's ( 1995 ) formulation of the strong feature condition . ( xxvi ) alpha and beta cannot be concatenated if some sublabel of alpha and some sublabel of beta are both strong ( p95 ) thus , the proposed simplification of the strong feature condition actually results in positing two conditions , one of which is an s - structure condition . another seemingly anti - minimalist proposal is the chain formation condition , given in ( xxiii ) above and repeated in ( xxvii ) below . ( xxvii ) chain formation condition an application of move forms 1 or > 1 chain ( s ) only if it is legitimate ( = violation-free ) minimalist theory claims that the computation of human language meets the inclusiveness condition , i . e . no new elements are added during the course of the computation . instead , the computation arranges and rearranges items selected from the lexicon . therefore , under minimalist theory , the notion of a "" chain "" as an independent entity does not exist , as it would have to be added during the course of the derivation , violating inclusiveness . instead , "" chain "" is simply a convenient term used to refer to the identical elements in a derivation . the chain formation condition , however , crucially requires chains to have an independent existence in the computation . these comments aside , this book does represent a step forward in the minimalist research program . kitahara is able to derive several assumptions / principles which previously could only be stipulated . the account of optionality in icelandic object shift is more satisfying than the "" optional strong feature "" approach , although , as was noted , it does raise some cross - linguistic considerations ( e . g . french ) . the systematic application of the minimal link condition to data captured by various other conditions was sorely needed , if only to confirm the intuitions that an mlc would have equal , or superior , empirical coverage . finally , the analysis of "" wh "" extraction asymmetries presented in the final chapter , is one of the few minimalist treatments of this phenomenon . all in all , the reader will find this book to be very well considered , clearly explained , and thought-provoking . biography julie anne legate is a phd student in the department of linguistics and philosophy at mit . her research interests include syntactic theory and irish syntax . bibliography chomsky , noam .

Banc of America Securities begins coverage of Power Integrations with a ""market performer"" rating in tech notes 7/16/02 
Analyst Douglas Lee says the maker of power supply integrated circuits is building a market niche with a more efficient and reliable technology than traditional approaches to converting AC-to-DC power supplies. He also notes Power Integrations is expanding its market with DC-to-DC power supply products, and says the firm's growth is based on converting today's power supplies to its more efficient technologies. As a result, the company doesn't need a boost in end-market demand to grow, Lee says. Although he sees a large, untapped market for Power Integrations and likes its long-term prospects, Lee suggests the stock is fairly valued. He believes shares of POWI are unlikely to rise much in the short term.POWER INTEGRATIONS 18.72 5.23%

you'd like (though I don't remember what Preferences... option allows

the existing Sedit window prior to composition.I currently have 6 different sig files I can choose between.Additionally, if a .signature file has the execute bit turned on, 
exmh will attempt to execute the file and use the stdout of the

"(Fax) to  my direct confidential  Fax No: 234 1 7591666  Dr. Kataga Bakori
Lagos, Nigeria.
23rd July 2002
Attention President/C.E.O
                   
Dear Sir,REQUEST FOR URGENT BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP.Firstly I must solicit your strictest confidence in this subject. This is by virtue of its nature as 
being utterly confidential and top secret. A member of the Nigeria Export Promotion Council 
(N.E.P.C.) who was part of the federal government delegation to your country during a trade 
exhibition gave your particulars to me. I have decided to seek a confidential operation with 
you in the execution of the deal described hereunder for the benefit of all the parties and 
hope that you keep it top secret because of the nature of the business.Within the ministry of petroleum resources where I work as a director of engineering and 
projects, and with the co-operation of four other very top officials, we have under our 
control as overdue contract payments, bills totaling Thirty One Million United States Dollars, 
which we want to transfer to a foreign account, with the assistance and co-operation of a 
foreign company to receive the said funds on our behalf or a reliable foreign individual 
account to receive the funds.The source of the fund is as follows: during the last military government here in Nigeria 
which lasted bout eleven months, government officials set up companies and awarded 
themselves various contracts which were grossly over-invoiced in various ministries.  The 
present civilian government is not aware of the atrocities committed by their predecessors 
and as a result, we have a lot of such over invoiced contract payment s pending which we 
have identified floating at the central bank of Nigeria ready for payment.  However by virtue 
of our position as civil servants, we cannot acquire this money in our names.  I was 
therefore delegated as a matter of urgency by my colleagues to look for an over seas 
partner into whose account we would transfer the sum of  US$31,000,000.00 (THIRTY 
ONE MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS) hence we are writing you this letter. the present civilian government is determined to pay foreign contractors l debts owed 
so as to maintain an amiable relationship with foreign governments and non-government 
financial agencies.  We have decided to include our bills for approval with the co-operation 
of some officials of the federal ministry of finance (F.M.F) and the central bank of Nigeria 
(C.B.N).  We are seeking your assistance in providing us with a good company account or 
any other offshore bank account into which we can remit this money by acting our main 
partner and trustee or acting as the original contractor.  This we can do by swapping of 
account information and changing of beneficiary and other pertinent information to apply for 
payment.  By this act, we would be using your company information to apply for payment, 
and prepare letters of claim and job description on behalf of your company.  This process 
would be an internal arrangement with the departments concerned.I have the authority of my partners involved to propose that should you be willing to assist 
us in this transaction, your share as compensation will be us$6.2 million (20%), us$21.7 
million (70%) for us and us$3.1 (10%) for 
taxation and miscellaneous expenses.The business itself is 100% safe, provided you treat it with utmost secrecy and 
confidentiality.  Also your area of specialization is not m hindrance to the successful 
execution of this transaction.  I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will 
not disappoint me. I will bring the complete picture of the transaction to your 
knowledge when I have heard from you.Thanks for your co-operation,Yours faithfully,Dr. Kataga BakoriNB: Please respond by sending a facsimile (Fax) to  my direct confidential  Fax No: 234 1

It occurs at the very end of an excellent article which I recommend to you.In the story, an old man enters a church where the congregation has been listening to an heroic sermon about ""the glory to be won in battle by young patriots armed with the love of God."" He usurps the pulpit and prays the following:""O Lord our God, help us to tear their soldiers to bloody shreads with our shells; help us to cover their smiling fields with the pale forms of their patriot dead; help us to drown the thunder of the guns with the shrieks of their wounded, writhing in pain; help us to lay waste their humble homes with a hurricane of fire; help us to wring the hearts of their unoffending widows with unavailing grief; help us to turn them out roofless with their little children to wander unfriended the wastes of their desolated land in rags and hunger and thirst, sports of the sun flames in summer and the icy winds of winter, broken in spirit, worn with travail, imploring Thee for the refuge of the grave and denied it -- for our sakes who adore Thee, Lord, blast their hopes, blight their lives, protract their bitter pilgrimage, make heavy their steps, water their way with their tears, stain the white snow with the blood of their wounded feet! We ask it, in the spirit of love, of Him Who is the Source of Love, and Who is the ever-faithful refuge and friend of all that are sore beset and seek His aid with humble and contrite hearts. Amen.""Twain wrote the story, ""The War Prayer,"" in 1905 during the American occupation of the Philippines, but the story wasn't printed until 1923, thirteen years after his death, because the editors thought it ""unsuitable"" for publication at the time it was written.# distributed via : no commercial use without permission # is a moderated mailing list for net criticism, # collaborative text filtering and cultural politics of the nets # more info: majordomo@bbs.thing.net and ""info nettime-l"" in the msg body # archive: http://www.nettime.org contact: nettime@bbs.thing.net--- end forwarded text -- ----------------- R.

The above situation occurs precisely because of the major functional difference
between symbolic links (AKA soft links, or symlinks to their friends) and hard
links. Two hard links to the same file are exactly equivalent - one is no more
the files ""real"" directory entry than is the other. OTOH a symlink is a special
thing which is a link to a real file, and when the file linked to is erased, you
end up with a broken symbolic link - you can't have a broken hard link (except
of course in the case of a banjaxed filesystem).

"""the historical record"", by which you mean *human* historical record, is
highly overrated (nigh worthless) when you are talking about geological
timescales, even on topics with as short a timescale as climate.My problem with global warming (or cooling for that matter), is that the
supposedly profound recent changes in temperature, both in absolute
terms and as a function time, very arguably fall well below the noise
floor of the natural fluctuations that have occurred over the last
50,000 years both in terms of absolute average temperature and the rate
of temperature change.  People unfamiliar with history of global
temperature since the advent of modern humans may think that a degree
here or there over a century is a lot, not realizing that global
temperatures regularly whipsaw with far greater extremity.  I therefore 
immediately dismiss any theory of global warming that cannot explain why
temperatures whipsawed more severely in pre-history than in the last
couple thousand years (which have been relatively calm by geological
standards).  This is a very inconvenient fact for people trying to use
climate to push a particular social agenda.It is worth noting that underneath the receding glaciers deposited
during the last major ice age, they are finding substantial evidence of
humans living in what was a nice temperate climate before the glaciers
paved over their civilization.  The receding glaciers have turned into a
bit of an archaeological treasure chest, as they expose artifacts buried
in and underneath them as they shrink that have been preserved by the
ice for thousands of years.  I don't see any compelling reason to ""save
the glaciers"" anyway, particularly in light of the fact that their
existence has always been transient.For anyone to insist that the current negligible fluctuations are
anthropogenic just heaps one ridiculous assertion upon another.  I'll
just stick with Occam's Razor for now.In my humble opinion.Cheers,-James Rogers

"Once upon a time, Mark wrote :> I remember apt-get dist-upgrading from 7.2 to 7.3 fine, so it -should- 
> work, maybe :)I've done that too, on many production servers. The only little
(unimportant) catch is to replace ""kernel-headers"" by ""glibc-kernheaders"",
a simple ""apt-get install glibc-kernheaders"" taking care of that.Upgrading between releases is meant to work, not between betas or beta and
releases. The reason is simple : Some packages may have been downgraded,
some others may have been rebuilt with the same versions but different
dependencies. For both these categories of packages, the upgrade through
apt/rhn/whatever just won't do, as some older packages might be considered
as the newest, thus being kept on the system.As Red Hat does, I really don't recommend trying to upgrade between betas
or from a beta to a final release either. Simply backup your /home, /etc
(and /root and/or /usr/local/ if needed) then reinstall cleanly, it'll
probably save a few hassles and you'll get the cleanest possible system ;-)Matthias--

remember friend , this is assuming only 10 people ordering out of 5 , 000 you mailed to . dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half or even one 4 th of those people mailed 100 , 000 e - mails each or more ? there are over 150 million people on the internet worldwide and counting , with thousands more coming on line every day . believe me , many people will do just that , and more ! method # 2 : by placing free ads on the internet advertising on the net is very , very inexpensive and there are hundreds of free places to advertise . placing a lot of free ads on the internet will easily get a larger response . we strongly suggest you start with method # 1 and add method # 2 as you go along . for every $ 5 you receive , all you must do is e - mail them the report they ordered . that ' s it . always provide same day service on all orders . this will guarantee that the e - mail they send out , with your name and address on it , will be prompt because they can not advertise until they receive the report . = = = = = = = = = = = available reports = = = = = = = = = = = = = = the reason for the "" cash "" is not because this is illegal or somehow "" wrong "" . it is simply about time . time for checks or credit cards to be cleared or approved , etc . concealing it is simply so no one can see there is money in the envelope and steal it before it gets to you . order each report by its number & name only . notes : always send $ 5 cash ( u . s . currency ) for each report . checks not accepted . make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper . on one of those sheets of paper , write the number & the name of the report you are ordering , your e - mail address and your name and postal address . place your order for these reports now : = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = report # 1 : ' the insider ' s guide to advertising for free on the net order report # 1 from : y . l . wong p . o . box no . 71819 kowloon central post office hong kong report # 2 : the insider ' s guide to sending bulk email on the net order report # 2 from : martin veronneau c . p . 70058 laval , quebec h 7 r 5 z 2 canada report # 3 : secret to multilevel marketing on the net order report # 3 from : francis kidd p . o . box 209 homestead , pa 15120 usa report # 4 : how to become a millionaire using mlm & the net order report # 4 from : m . l . frayser p . o . box 61432 fort myers , fl 33906 usa report # 5 : how to send out one million emails for free order report # 5 from : stone evans 600 n . pearl , suite gl 03 dallas , tx 75201 usa $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ your success guidelines $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ follow these guidelines to guarantee your success : = = = if you do not receive at least 10 orders for report # 1 within 2 weeks , continue sending e - mails until you do . = = = after you have received 10 orders , 2 to 3 weeks after that you should receive 100 orders or more for report # 2 . if you did not , continue advertising or sending e - mails until you do . * * once you have received 100 or more orders for report # 2 , you can relax , because the system is already working for you , and the cash will continue to roll in ! this is important to remember : every time your name is moved down on the list , you are placed in front of a different report . you can keep track of your progress by watching which report people are ordering from you . if you want to generate more income send another batch of e - mails and start the whole process again . there is no limit to the income you can generate from this business !

Tech stocks drop again on Qwest criminal probe news
Word telecom Qwest Communications International is being investigated by the U.S. Attorney's office in Denver helped send technology shares lower Wednesday.Despite a Merrill Lynch upgrade of Cisco Systems and the fact that J.P. Morgan began coverage on AOL Time Warner with a ""buy"" rating, CNET's Tech index fell 26.23 points, or 2.66 percent, to 965.29. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index lost 35.11 points, or 2.54 percent, to 1,346.01--a multi-year low.Broader markets also shed value, dragged down in part by a troubled pharmaceutical sector. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 282.5 points, or 3.11 percent, to 8,813.5, and the S&P 500 slid 32.36 points, or 3.52 percent, to 920.47--also a multi-year low.
AT&T, Comcast Shareholders OK Broadband Deal 
Shareholders of AT&T Corp. and Comcast Corp. on Wednesday approved the planned $27 billion merger of AT&T Broadband with Comcast, which will create the nation's largest cable TV operator with more than 22 million customers.
Telephone giant AT&T in December agreed to sell its cable television unit to Comcast as part of a restructuring that dismantled its vision of becoming a one-stop shop for telephone, data and video services.AT&T CORP 9.78 -2.30% $215 million later, start-up Pluris shuts down 
Networking start-up Pluris will release a statement Wednesday announcing it has closed its doors because of a lack of funding and ongoing woes in the market it serves, according to a spokeswoman familiar with the company's plans.
Pluris, a once promising company, burned through $215 million over the past few years as it attempted to build a high-end router that was intended to outclass similar products from competitors such as Juniper Networks and Cisco Systems.CISCO SYSTEMS 13.51 2.82% WorldCom contracts under U.S. scrutiny 
The accounting scandal at WorldCom has prompted U.S. government agencies to scrutinize the telecommunications company's billions of dollars in federal contracts.
The Federal Aviation Administration, for one, has been forced to take stock of the situation quickly. WorldCom is a finalist for a 20-year, $3.5 billion contract with the FAA. The contract is expected to be awarded as soon as this week. The company is the incumbent on the contract, which supplies phone and data infrastructure to the nation's air traffic control systems.WORLDCOM INC-WORLDCOM TRCK STK 0.20 -3.81%

Banc of America Securities lowers estimates and price target on IBM in notes 7/10/02 
Analyst Joel Wagonfeld argues the computer giant is not immune to the persistent, widespread weakness in IT spending. But a roughly 6 percent dip in revenues during the second quarter will be offset by the elimination of losses from the discontinued hard disk drive business, Wagonfeld predicts. In IBM's second-quarter results, he expects continued weakness in hardware but relative strength in software and outsourcing. The company's decision to exit or restructure unprofitable, commodity businesses is sound, Wagonfeld says. He reiterates a ""buy"" rating on IBM.INTL BUSINESS MACHINES 68.76 -1.31%

"" dynegy later issued a press release indicating it is "" continuing our confirmatory due diligence "" regarding the merger . neither enron nor dynegy returned calls seeking comment . after plunging 23 % tuesday to $ 6 . 99 , enron was down a staggering 34 % at one point wednesday . it moved slightly higher after the midday press release to trade at $ 4 . 90 . enron shares have lost more than 80 % of their value since the company issued its third - quarter earnings release last month . dynegy dropped $ 2 . 44 , to $ 39 . 26 , though it remains substantially above premerger levels . at the heart of enron ' s trouble is the sense that the company isn ' t letting on the full extent of its troubles . the selloff in enron shares began in earnest oct . 16 , when the company disclosed in an earnings conference call that it would take a $ 1 . 2 billion writedown to unwind some related - party transactions . critics of the company said those deals , in which the company did business with separate entities involving enron managers , raised serious ethical and disclosure issues . the dynegy merger was taken as a vote of confidence for enron , since as a big trading partner dynegy would appear to have a solid grasp of enron ' s situation . as a result , shares in both companies rallied after the deal ' s announcement . but monday ' s disclosure that enron faced $ 690 million in bond payments next week reignited worries that the company faced steeper challenges than it has detailed . according to a merrill lynch report cited in the new york times wednesday , dynegy wasn ' t aware of the $ 690 million obligation . critics of the deal wondered whether enron had told dynegy about all its obligations . liquidity fears have also been rekindled by information contained in a filing of quarterly results that show the company consumed as much as $ 5 billion of cash in recent weeks . by the end of 2002 , enron has to find around $ 9 billion to pay back various obligations . it had $ 1 . 2 billion in cash on hand as of nov . 16 , according to the filing . tellingly , dynegy shares haven ' t plunged along with enron , suggesting that investors see a collapse of the merger as catastrophic for enron but not for dynegy . at current levels , enron shares are trading at more than a 50 % discount to the dynegy offer . j . p . morgan has taken a leading role in helping enron . it has lent funds and it helped restructure the $ 690 million obligation . the bank ' s stock was down 78 cents to $ 38 . 62 . "" we will work with enron and its other primary lenders to develop a plan to strengthen enron ' s financial position up to and through its merger with dynegy , "" said james lee , a top banker at morgan , in the enron release . from cbs . marketwatch . com , online at : dynegy , enron say merger to proceed by myra p . saefong 1 : 52 pm et nov 21 , 2001 washington ( cbs . mw ) - - merger partners enron and dynegy restated their commitment wednesday to completing a deal , on the heels of embattled enron ' s announcement that its lead lender granted it more time to pay off a $ 690 million note set to come due next week . "" we are continuing our confirmatory due diligence and working to accelerate the regulatory approvals required to complete the merger , "" said chuck watson , dynegy ' s chairman and chief executive , in a statement . shares of enron ( ene ) recovered slightly in afternoon trading but remained under pressure . on heavy volume , the stock - - which had touched $ 4 earlier in the session - - was down $ 1 . 83 to trade at $ 5 . 16 , a new 10 - year low . some 84 million shares had changed hands . enron declined 23 percent tuesday after the company revealed the upcoming debt deadline and restated its earnings . meanwhile , dynegy shares lost $ 1 . 83 to stand at $ 39 . 87 . enron said that the lead bank on the $ 690 million debt agreed to extend the maturity date to mid - december , which will give the company time to restructure the facility , and added it expects to further restructure its debt . "" we . . . believe we can identify a mutually beneficial restructuring to enhance our cash position , strengthen our balance sheet , and address upcoming maturities , "" said jeff mcmahon , chief financial officer , in a statement . j . p . morgan chase co . said it and other lenders are committed to helping enron improve its financial position . also , enron reaffirmed its commitment to a merger with dynegy and said it closed on a previously announced $ 450 million line of credit from j . p . morgan , collateralized by the company ' s northern natural gas co . enron - - which is being acquired by its smaller rival dynegy ( dyn ) at a fire - sale price - - revealed in a securities and exchange commission filing monday that it had to pay off or refinance $ 690 million in debt obligations by next monday or risk triggering nearly $ 4 billion in additional payments . if enron had missed that deadline and didn ' t post collateral , investors had the right to demand immediate liquidation of the assets of one of enron ' s limited partnerships , the unusual business entities at the center of the company ' s murky transactions currently under investigation . the sec filing of monday also contained yet another restatement of financial results on the heels of a similar filing that disclosed more than four years of restated earnings figures . earlier wednesday , goldman sachs lowered its rating on enron ' s stock to "" market performer "" from its "" u . s . recommended list , "" citing "" major "" liquidity issues and concerns over whether the company can recover the business it has lost . cibc world markets also cut enron to a "" hold "" from a "" buy . "" commerzbank weighed in wednesday , saying enron ' s viability is in doubt . "" we believe the filing clearly shows that enron remains in a precarious financial position and its status as a going concern is much in doubt , "" analysts andre meade and andrew smith wrote . "" it appears that enron ' s situation could worsen in a number of ways . "" though enron ' s most recent disclosures shed more light on the fiscal situation , meade and smith characterized the information as "" piecemeal . "" "" it appears that the full extent of enron ' s problems is not currently known , "" they said in a note , cautioning clients against investing in enron .",Safe Email

today!I've very excited about the in-planning Penguin Shell volunteer project. 
Apparently, you are too. I've received more than 100 emails from readers volunteering a wide range of IT skills for charitable organizations. 
Linux users, Windows users, even a few Mac users are ready, willing and able to 
spend their own precious off time providing qualified technical skills for a 
good cause. I've also gotten more than two dozen suggestions for organizations that might be in need of such skills. And, I've 
seen some very interesting suggestions for names for our project. Feel free to click through on any of the 
above links to join the ever-growing bandwagon. Do me a favor, though. keep the 
subject lines intact. It's the only way your messages will filter and sort 
through my email system.It looks like Apple may have crossed a line of irritation with its users. 
According to this article on The Register, Apple has tacked a $100 annual fee on its
previously free mac.com email service. It's also set the price for an OS 10.2
upgrade at $129.I won't question Apple's decision too much. Instead, it really proves how 
difficult things have become in the tech world in the past few years. Revenues, 
by and large, are still decreasing from the pie-in-the-sky late 90s and early 
2000. That's left companies to scramble for new sources of income, some of which 
were previously free. Even we at Lockergnome have felt the pinch in the past few 
years. Never fear, though. Chris has assured us that the newsletters will remain 
free. We have, however, begun to explore alternative income sources.On a brighter note, it looks like Mandrake has found a sweet spot. According to their most 
recent shareholder's report, the third quarter was the strongest in the 
company's
history, with 1.6 million Euro (1.61 million US) in revenue. That doesn't put
them in the black, though. According to MandrakeSoft, the strong quarter will
only decrease operating losses. I have to wonder how much of this revenue was
the result of the Mandrake Linux User's
Club.The news also makes me want to pay a bit more attention to Mandrake's newest
partnership venture, an agreement with Microtel to provide Mandrake-loaded computers for sale on WalMart.com.
I would never have guessed that WalMart would lead the consumer Linux machine
charge. They've had Mandrake boxes available for several months. Now, with the 
addition of both Lindows 
and Mandrake-equipped computers, they seem surprisingly ahead of the retail 
computer pack. Let's hope for the best for all involved.Have a great Wednesday.

procmail and pine for reading and filtering my email, KMail is a strong 
contender in the email race. As you'd guess, it's fully integrated into the KDE 
desktop, ready for a quick setup and easy use.There's one drawback to KMail, though, in my opionion. That's that it doesn't 
automatically check your email by default when the program is opened. As much 
time as I spend talking about saving key and mouse strokes, you knew the 
additional step to check your email after opening the program would be an 
irritation to this Penguin. However, changing the problem is a quick and simple 
configuration issue.To force KMail to check your email when opened, right-click on the KMail icon in your KDE panel. Select ""Preferences"" and the ""Execute"" tab. In the Execute 
window, change the command line to read:Â Â Â Â kmail --check -caption ""%c"" %i %mThe addition of the --check option will force KMail to bring you your mail when 
you open the program.Fewer keystrokes make a happy geek, right?

Kernel Configuration - Part XIIIAs you well know, Linux is simply the most robust operating system for 
networking around. With its roots squarely in the network, Linux has managed to 
stay ahead of the pack in virtually every respect related to networks. It should come as little suprise, then, that the network section of your Linux kernel 
configuration is dense with details and options.I will say that I warned you on Monday - there are going to be some sections of 
the kernel configuration series where I just can't give you a stock 
configuration that will work in every case. Networking is one of those areas. 
You're going to have to give some thought as to how your network is or will be 
used and the level of security you want to provide (both internal and external). Then, it's a matter of finding the solutions to those options.For security issues, I can recommend several good articles and HowTos:
The Linux Security Quickstart HowTo
Â Â covers security on a high level, with a good discussion of kernel 
configuration issues
Linux Network Security from Linux Planet
Â Â a nice tutorial on network security
Network Security with /proc/sys/net/ipv4
Â Â other approaches to network security
These should get you started. Tomorrow, we'll cover telephony support in your 
Linux kernel.

at high speed without requiring the extra disk space and processing time usually needed by visual audio editing tools, which convert the MP3 format to more 
easily manageable formats like WAV before doing anything. It reads and cuts

Linux PR
http://linuxpr.com/If the daily Linux news sites are starting to get you down, maybe it's time for 
a change. Linux PR is an up-to-the-minute listing of events and developments in 
the Linux world. The layout is attractive, with all the most recent articles in 
descending order on the front page. It makes quick scans easy. The only real 
downside to the news on the site is that some of it is very, very 
company-oriented - clearly the work of PR firms cranking out press releases. 
Other than that, Linux PR is a useful site for checking in and keeping up on 
your favorite OS.

thing. Which, presumably involves sticking your outgoing going message
in the right queue. Then you need your postfix SMTP client to
authenticate with your postfix SMTP server. Are you using SASL? If so,
I remember seeing documentation on how to configure the postfix SMTP
client to authenticate.Nick

The thing is, I hadn't used gconf-editor yet... and it's exactly what I
feared, old ""not so good"" memories are coming back : It looks exactly like
a GNOME RegEdit :-/ Oh well.
I still hope that the few missing features I'm still looking for will be
added in the next 2.0.x releases, like for example being able to have the
panel always under *all* other windows (if you know how to do that, I'm
really interested! ;-)).Cheers,

) . takeover speculation gave enron shares a boost wednesday , helping it end a 10 - day losing streak . but it ' s unlikely anyone is going to step into this mess before a securities and exchange commission investigation into its finances yields a few more answers . for investors , a short - term rally beyond the jump wednesday is still possible now that all of the big mutual funds have dumped the shares . but at a closing price of $ 13 . 90 , enron shares are more than a texas mile from their 52 - week high of $ 84 . 88 last december . for enron itself , it ' s time to put its cards on the table with regulators and wall street . as the drexel saga showed , a strategy of defiance to the end only hastens the end .",Safe Email

"" deutsche banc alex . brown was among several brokerage firms downgrading fourth - quarter projections for natural - gas prices last week . "" prior to sept . 11 , we were seeing signs that a lot of industrial demand was coming back , "" said jay saunders , a deutsche banc analyst . "" but all that is out the window now . "" deutsche banc is now estimating a 20 % drop in winter demand in the industrial sector , which accounts for more than a quarter of total u . s . natural - gas consumption . the slack demand has resulted in supplies that have practically overflowed storage , which is on pace to be full by the end of october . while prices that are close to historical levels are good for consumers , such low prices could scare many producers away from making investments to ensure future natural - gas demand is met . lower prices have already led energy companies to slow their drilling and some firms , such as eog resources inc . , plan to moderate production in the next two months . gas drilling - rig counts fell to 953 last week from 1 , 030 at the end of august . even with the increased natural - gas drilling of earlier this year , overall natural - gas supply is expected to increase just 1 % this year , as the country ' s mature wells continue to be depleted faster than companies can replace them . the tight supply picture has analysts optimistic that prices will rebound next year amid lower interest rates , increased defense and relief spending and returning consumer confidence . still , the downturn could cause some firms to rethink or postpone projects to import gas in a liquid form . with prices high last winter , el paso corp . and enron corp . , among others , said they would build a dozen or so receiving terminals for liquefied natural gas , which is gas compressed and frozen to minus - 260 degrees fahrenheit . "" you will see some cancellations and some delays , "" predicts marshall adkins , an analyst with raymond james & associates in houston . natural - gas prices need to average $ 3 per million btus on the east coast and $ 3 . 50 on the west coast to justify bringing in lng to those areas , said ronald barone , an analyst with ubs warburg . a spokeswoman for el paso , houston , says the company is moving forward with at least three terminals for the u . s . market . enron said it is also pushing ahead with a terminal in the bahamas that would pipe the gas to florida starting in 2004 . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . enron leases part of mumbai estate to citibank freny patel mumbai 10 / 02 / 2001 business standard 5 copyright ( c ) business standard after months of scouting for a buyer for its one lakh square feet office space at wockhardt towers in bandra - kurla complex , enron has been able lease out 10 , 000 square feet of it to citibank na . against an expected realisation from rs 130 crore for the outright sale of its four floors , enron will get around rs 1 . 2 crore a year by leasing out one floor to citibank . the deal was struck recently by the global real estate consultant , cushman & wakefield , at a monthly rental of rs 100 per square foot . with property prices in mumbai having slumped and with no reprieve expected in the short run , companies are increasingly opting to lease space instead of blocking funds in illiquid assets . property consultants say that if enron manages to lease out the entire four floors , it will be easier for it to sell the property to a buyer , as the buyer would be assured of a fixed income . enron had eyed a deal of rs 130 crore when it mandated global real estate consultants to sell the premises at around rs 12 , 000 per square foot . this is despite the fact that real estate at bandra kurla currently fetches rs 8 , 000 to rs 9 , 000 per square feet . in june 2000 , the us energy giant had shelled out rs 125 . 75 crore when it acquired the four floors , plus car park space , from wockhardt , the pharmaceutical company . the deal was struck at rs 10 , 500 per sq ft , and included parking space for 101 cars . industry sources said that enron had spent a sum close to rs 150 crore to acquire the property , and pay for the interior furnishings of two of the four floors it had acquired . in order for it to break even , it would have had to sell its real estate at the rate of rs 13 , 000 per square foot . four to five global real estate consultants have been appointed by enron for the sale of its premises . a leading consultant said that it has been difficult to find any buyers for such a large property . "" most international buyers prefer to take property on lease instead of an outright purchase , "" he added . moreover , the inefficiency of the building in terms of the super built - up area is another reason why corporate entities are not too eager to acquire the premises , and enron ' s proposition continues to go abegging , said the consultant . copyright ? 2000 dow jones ranking includes 14 newcomers though hewlett - packard lost $ 65 billion in market value in a year , ceo carly fiorina hasn ' t lost her nerve , and for the fourth consecutive year holds the no . 1 position on fortune ' s ranking of the 50 most powerful women in business . the complete list and accompanying stories are in the october 15 issue of fortune , available on newsstands october 8 and at www . fortune . com at 12 : 00 p . m . on october 1 . in the no . 2 spot is ebay ceo meg whitman , who runs an internet company that actually makes money : $ 85 million in the last four quarters on $ 582 million in revenue . oprah winfrey , the queen of media , is mightier than ever , and holds the no . 3 spot , up from no . 15 last year . she produces movies , brings comfort and advice to millions of tv viewers , propels books to bestsellerdom , and , last year , teamed up with hearst magazines ' cathie black ( no . 28 on the list ) to publish o , the oprah magazine - by some measures the most successful magazine startup ever . at no . 4 is andrea jung , chairman and ceo of avon , who has breathed life into ailing avon . mirant ceo marce fuller - the only newcomer in the top five - holds the no . 5 position . inside a stodgy utility , southern , fuller built a high - growth trading and marketing unit , which was spun off in april . in these new , more tempered times , patience may be about to reap its reward . in fortune ' s annual survey of the 50 most powerful women in business , there is a clear emergence of women who came to power slowly . says fortune senior writer pattie sellers in "" patient but not passive , "" the story that accompanies the list , "" by patience , we mean staying with a company , steadily building influence there , and rising to power through determination and insider knowledge , not promises and self - promotion . "" fiorina , who has claimed the top spot each year since fortune ' s inaugural list in 1998 , heads the biggest company ( $ 48 billion in revenues last year ) run by a woman . and she is still as audacious and impatient as ever . wall street practically heckled her latest move - a bold bet to buy compaq - but fiorina , 47 , remains defiant . in difficult times , "" people who drive change are the subject of great scrutiny , "" she says . as always , the list is a snapshot of power at a moment in time . last year , power resided in the technology and internet sectors , but that influence was fleeting . gone from the list this year : deborah "" hurricane debby "" hopkins , who pushed her agenda too ambitiously at lucent and lost her cfo job in may ; ellen hancock , who failed at the startup , exodus ; and morgan stanley ' s mary meeker , who influenced so many to buy into the internet fizz . but one web warrior looks better than ever : meg whitman , no . 2 on the list . she has never overpromised to investors ; instead she has diligently delivered above - target profits every single quarter . fourteen newcomers join the list this year : marce fuller , president louise kitchen , coo , enron americas ; colleen barrett , president betsy bernard , president & ceo , at anne stevens , vp , north america vehicle operations , ford motor ; maria elena lagomasino , chairman susan desmond - hellman , evp and chief medical officer , genentech ; janet robinson , svp , newspaper operations , new york times co . ; carol tomi , evp and cfo , home depot ; carrie cox , evp and president , global prescriptions , pharmacia ; carole black , president and ceo , lifetime television networks ; janet davidson , group president , integrated network solutions , lucent ; larree renda , evp , retail operations , safeway ; and louise francesconi , vp and gm , missile systems , raytheon . while the economy and its points of power change , the criteria we use to evaluate power remains the same . says sellers : "" we consider the size and importance of a woman ' s business in the global economy , her clout inside her company , and the arc of her career - where she has been and where she is likely to go . when appropriate , we also weigh the woman ' s influence on mass culture and society . that factor lifts oprah winfrey to no . 3 on this year ' s list . "" the shifts on our list this year are dramatic , with 14 newcomers . but one trend is especially intriguing : women are taking on bigger businesses than ever . a few years ago , responsibility for a $ 3 billion business almost automatically earned a woman a spot on this list . no more . this year ' s fortune 50 includes several women who lead businesses with annual revenues of $ 20 billion or more , which is a first . in a related story , "" it took a lady to save avon , "" katrina brooker looks at andrea jung , chairman and ceo of avon . says brooker , "" jung knows what women want and how to sell it to them . and that ' s what has made her one of the most successful ceos - male or female - in recent years . "" over the past 20 months she has overhauled nearly everything about the way avon does business : how it advertises , manufactures , packages , and even sells its products , and she has done it not by abandoning the seemingly outdated avon lady , but by reviving her . the result : growth in revenues , operating profits , and operating margins . in addition , fortune includes an international list of the 50 powerful women in business . the top ten , featured in the magazine , are marjorie scardino , ceo , pearson ( britain ) ; anne lauvergeon , chairman , areva ( france ) ; mary ma , senior vp marianne nivert , president lien siaou -

Then again, if 57% of CEOs have the time to be as up on technology as
their CIO, either one or maybe even /both/ of them are maybe not doing
their job, and maybe that's yet another reason the dot-bubble burst.Mind you, I've been head-butting with 'tech-expert' captains (and
cooks) all my life.  It's probably my own damn fault for making what I
do /look/ so easy, and also probably why 'metal guitarists grimmace so
when playing a simple rubato ;)--

"typological classification a few remarks on fritz newmeyer 's posting on classification in language typology : of course it is not always easy to decide to which type a given language should be assigned , since there may be conflicting criteria . but some people seem to think that this is somehow a deep problem with language typology . in reality , there is no deep problem here at all , so the typological literature is quite right in not dwelling on such trivial methodological points too much , concentrating on substantive and theoretical issues instead . true , the methodology of language typology is somewhat different from the methodology used in single-language studies that most linguists engange in . when searching for significant correlations between features / parameters in the world 's language , one has to classify languages , and the more languages one looks at , the less energy one can spend on resolving each individual case . clearly , the speacialist will sometimes disagree with the way her or his language was assigned , but then most of them time not all specialists agree on the right classification themselves . when the criteria are in conflict , it may sometimes be necessary to give more weight to some than to others in a somewhat arbitrary way - - but this is simply one reflection of the necessary idealization that accompanies any serious scientific endeavor . it 's as simple as that : the more one studies linguistic phenomena in breadth , the more one loses in depth . but vice versa , linguists that study only one or a few languages are working on an extremely narrow basis and lose in breadth what they gain in depth . ideally , typological research should be conducted by teams of linguists , much in the same way as research in big science is organized . with more resources that are combined , one could study linguistic phenomena in considerable breadth and depth simultaneously . an attempt to follow this strategy has been made in the european science programme in language typology , which has been running in europe for the past five years ( wait for 10 volumes on the typology of european languages , to appear with mouton de gruyter in a year 's time ) . this was only a very modest , seriously underfunded attempt , but until we attract really big research money or manage to agree on more things , we have to be happy that we have colleagues like johanna nichols who are willing to make enormous efforts to get a view of linguistic phenomena on a global scale . martin haspelmath ( free university of berlin )",Safe Email

hmm. there are versions of OpenBSD that run from a 32M compact flash IIRC.and antefacto's software ran in 64M.there are CF->IDE adapters anyway, so get a 256M CF (100â‚¬+), mount it RO,
and use that?/me is also in the market for one of the 60W fanless PSU's that antefacto had,
if someone wants to get a few of them.L.

affiliate program?I've mentioned how Yahoo Mail's beta is mangling our commas, but
did you know that it's also (possibly) rewriting your e-mail? If
you send an HTML message to someone who has a yahoo.com account,
something may get lost in the translation. Try sending this
sentence: ""My medieval mocha has an expression to evaluate.""
Again, be sure this note is sent in HTML format. The results will
surprise you. As far as I can tell, they're doing this to stop any
scripts from being distributed to their user base. I must credit
Marion Schroll for making me aware of the ""problem."" It's kinda
funny, in a weird sort of way. Not that I would want anything I
send changed in any way, shape, or form. It begs the question:
what next? I mean, where does it all stop? Give them a bit, and
they just might take a byte. Censorship is only a stone's throw
away.I really feel for Lockergnomie Sharon Clark, who asks: ""What is
this crazy business with the broadband metering? What they
advertise doesn't seem to be what you get. Now that I'm forking
out $60 per month for a supposed metered rate of 640 down / 320
up, I'm feeling clueless and left out in the cold. Not sure what
I'm paying for, not sure what's going on at the office, not sure
if I'm capped, not sure if I'm getting ripped off! Can you help me
out here? I'm feeling lied to; why can't I download 'til my 40 gig
is full? That is what they promised me and that is what I THOUGHT
I was paying for. I want consistent speed - is this too much to
ask?"" It's not too much to ask the question, but it's probably too
much to get the answer. I'm facing the same dilemma right now,
even though cable-based connectivity isn't available in my area.
Expect more and more ""filters"" to be put in place as time marches
on. Watch those EULAs, folks.See You in August,Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Chris PirilloÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â

I'd always end up with one or two that I just could never see. When I want to do the same type of comparison between two directories on my computer, I use Directory Lister and I never miss a thing. Not only does Directory Lister display the contents of your chosen directories, it will also let you save the output to an HTML file. This is great for web developers who want a quick way to list the contents of a ZIP file before archiving it and uploading it to their website. As an added bonus, Directory Lister also shows the date, time, and attributes of the files in your directory, making it easier than ever to compare the differences in files between two directories.
Web Calendar [25k] W2k/XP FREEhttp://members.lycos.co.uk/bleucanard/WebCalendar.htm{Web page reminder} Surfing the web as much as I do, I'll occasionally run into a site or page that commits the horrendous faux pas of displaying an ""Under Construction"" banner. I COULD forget about the site and maybe somehow encounter it later, or I COULD drop the site into Web Calendar and have this handy-dandy app remind me to check the page again in a week. The same technique holds true for my normal browsing... for example, I can use Web Calendar to remind me to check out the Digital Media newsletter every morning, or to check Amazon for a CD that I know will be released in a week. Now, I will have no excuse for missing the DVD release of ""Lord of the Rings""...Recommend It!

CollegeBAR v8.0 [5.9M] W9x/2k/XP US$20
    Unearthed by Shawn Verrallhttp://www.pracx.com/collegebar.asp
 
{Mix your own drinks} When I was in college, my room used to be known as ""The Bar."" It may have had something do with my L-shaped desk that resembled a bar, and the fact that I had seen the movie Cocktail too many times and wanted to be a bottle-flipping bartender. I never achieved my goal of being the world's best geek bartender, but maybe with College Bar I could have. College Bar contains recipes for over 11,600 drinks. With an online update feature, you can download new drinks as they become available... or you can add your own creative concoctions to the database! College Bar also has a calculator to determine someone's blood alcohol level... drink responsibly, folks. As an added bonus, you can load some of your favorite party pictures into the program and you'll see a slide show of those pictures - a great way to remember the good times... unless you don't remember experiencing them in the first place, that is.

Â GnomeTIPI am a sucker for keyboard shortcuts. Anything that can save me from using the mouse is good in my book. Occasionally I like to view the web or Windows Explorer in Full Screen mode... to do this I just hit F11 on the keyboard and there I am in Full Screen mode. Hit it again and I am back to regular mode. If you aren't as much of a fan of keyboard shortcuts as me, then all you have to do is press and hold the Ctrl key while clicking on the Maximize button and you will have the same effect. You will notice, however, that your Start Menu isn't anywhere to be seen. Never fear, another keyboard shortcut is here... just press Ctrl key plus the Esc key and your Start Menu will be back where it belongs. Alternatively, if you have a Windows key on your keyboard you can use that key to bring up your Start Menu as well.

( these are reliable people , so i feel confident that d speaks serrano ; d 's sister , who also spoke serrano , died recently . ) i live about a mile from the san manuel indian reservation . the people there are serrano , but most just know they are "" indian , "" they do n't know what "" tribe . "" at the tribal offices , the woman i spoke to was unaware that there had ever been a serrano language . the information i have so far comes from anthropology / archaeology people and linguists working at the morongo indian reservation ( cahuilla , in banning , california , united states ) . i ' m afraid that serrano will be history within the next couple of years . does anyone know where i might find information on the serrano language or the people who once spoke it ? * * * * * question 2 : hypothetical situation d , above , is the last remaining speaker of serrano . her serrano would be an idiolect , her personal serrano language . suppose i was able to capture all of her knowledge of the language before she dies and write a descriptive grammar which was then used by others to learn serrano , and the language survived . ( would n't it be nice if things worked that way ! ) would the original idiolect then be classified as a language ? dialect ? still an idiolect ? if serrano would still be an idiolect , since my understanding of the language would most likely be slightly different than d 's , would this be * my * ideolect , or * her * idiolect ? * * * * * question 3 : hualapai language ( in peach springs , arizona , united states ) soon , i will be moving to peach springs , arizona , to the hualapai indian reservation . i will be living there for about three months . the hualapai language is still widely used in peach springs ( still a small group of people though ) , and i am going to be doing a very intensive , crash course in hualapai ( two hours per day , every day , with two native speakers , as well as basic communication with other people outside my "" learning "" time ) . by the end of my stay , i hope to be able to communicate with others , but i ' m pretty sure i won't completely master the language in that short amount of time . my "" official job "" is setting up and fixing the computer network for the school there , but i will also be developing some computer applications in hualapai ( as opposed to an english language interface like we are used to seeing ) . i will also be working with the two native speakers to produce a few books written in hualapai . in addition to these books , i am going to try to translate some public-domain children 's classics , for example _ the wonderful wizard of oz _ , to help me with learning the language , as well as providing great stories for the kids there . i also plan on writing a journal of my learning of the hualapai language ( adult l2 acquisition study ) . i am a self-taught , amateur linguist - - i . e . , i read a lot and pester people with questions . the only formal education i have is a 10 - week course in ( english ) language acquisition by children . my question is , is there any interest outside the hualapai reservation for the software , books , or journal ? the books will be printed and we will need to know how many copies to print ( i . e . , just for use at the school , or extras for other people , too ) . a new edition of the hualapai grammar has been finished ( the old edition is 8 - 1 / 2 x 11 , 575 pages ; i have n't seen the new one yet ) , but not gone to the printers yet , and a dictionary is in the making . the software and journal can be duplicated as needed , but the books can be printed with title vii funds ( government money ) if they are for use at the school only , but we will have to make other funding arrangements if the books are to be sold to people outside the school . is anyone interested ? * * * * * fyi i developed a font for typing in hualapai . it is * not * intended to be a general-purpose , one-size - fits-all font , it is intended to allow rapid typing in hualapai . the font is a times typeface . currently , i have truetype and postsrcipt versions for ibm-pc compatible computers , and in the near future , macintosh versions of truetype and postscript fonts will be available . the sil ( summer institute of linguistics ) and a couple of sites in germany have offered me space on their ftp computers for the font . any other ftp sites would be appreciated . when i get the fonts uploaded , i ' ll post addresses to the lists . the font is "" postcard-ware , "" i . e . , it is free , but you have to send us a postcard from your hometown . : - ) * * * * * as is usual , i will post summaries of answers to my questions to the list if there is sufficient interest . thanks for wading through this long-winded message . chuck coker cjcoker @ csupomona . edu ccoker @ igc . apc . org",Safe Email
"FYI, members of this list might be interested in the 4th International
Workshop on Web Site Evolution (WSE 2002), being held October 2, 2002, in
Montreal, Canada.http://star.itc.it/wse2002/- Jim>>From the Web page: The potential of the Web as a vehicle for offering a variety of services is
becoming more apparent as Web sites evolve their contents from static
information to more dynamic and interactive forms. A number of new standards
and commercial products are emerging, offering a basis for developing
Web-based services from dynamic composible resources, extending both the
range and scope of services that can be made available through the Web.The goal of this one-day workshop is to bring together members of the Web
design, software engineering, and information technology communities to
discuss techniques for migrating to Web services. Architectural styles and
tool support for service-based Web sites are currently quite diverse.
Expertise in constructing service-based Web pages is quite limited, and
experience accounts are lacking. The explosion of non-traditional computing
platforms for browsing the Web, such as PDAs, WAP-enabled phones, and
Internet appliances, is forcing Web professionals to rethink the separation
of form from content and the range and scope of services offered via the
Web.WSE 2002 will provide an opportunity for the exchange of information related
to exciting new research and empirical results in areas including (but not
limited to):*   Migrating to Web services
*   Web quality determination and improvement through process and product
control
*   Enhancing Web sites to make them more accessible, reliable, and usable
*   Analyzing and reverse-engineering Web site content and structure
*   Making Web site content available in multiple formats for multiple
platforms
*   Applying traditional software engineering activities such as
architecture, metrics, and testing to Web sites
*   Case studies of large-scale Web site reuse, reengineering, and evolutionWSE 2002 is co-located with the IEEE International Conference on Software
Maintenance (ICSM 2002). ICSM is the IEEE Computer Society's flagship event
focused on the modernization of existing systems. ICSM 2002's theme of
""maintaining distributed heterogeneous systems"" nicely compliments WSE
2002's overall theme and goals.http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork

TCPA and Palladium: Content Control for the MassesWhile security experts poke and jab at what bits and pieces
of the TCPA and Palladium specs they can get ahold of, they
have tended to focus on how they work and what they imply as
far as concerns such as privacy and security go, or
alternatively, in terms of how they would impact the
functionality of the general purpose logic device.  Analysts
both favorable and unfavorable have been analyzing them from
these standpoints, while paying much less attention to what
the proposals imply from the standpoint of what content
control itself really means.The most significant problem with TCPA and Palladium is not
whether they may interfere with the power of the universal
logic device, or whether they are effectual from the
standpoint of privacy and security concerns, though these
are all very important concerns.  Rather, the fundamental
problem they present is in the political premises that they
hope to implement for the sake of the ""content industries.""TCPA and Palladium are the technological realization of the
concepts embodied in the WIPO Performances and Phonograms
Treaty (WPPT), which only came into effect this past May
20th (with little public notice or fanfare, of course).  The
WPPT declares an unprecedented ""moral right"" of authors to
control public uses of their works.*That's* the real game plan.TCPA and Palladium are simply content control for the
masses.  They constitute an effort to ""democratize"" content
control under the concept of ""moral rights,"" encouraging the
public to overlook the clear public interest issues raised
by the specter of content control, and to confuse these
issues with private interest issues such as privacy and
security.  They are an effort to get the public to jump on
the bandwagon without adequate consideration of what's
really on the line.In America, we have never supported the concept of ""moral
rights"" which the WPPT professes.  The US Constitution
accords Congress the power to grant (or deny) exclusive
rights to works and inventions for the purpose of promoting
the progress of the useful arts and sciences, not for the
purpose of rewarding the originality of creators -- though
that result is obviously a consequence of exclusive rights
statutes such as copyright law.  Our Supreme Court
explicitly articulates this distinction, and for very good
reason.  In America, we implicitly understand the
distinction between expression, the aspect of works to which
copyright statute applies, and the facts and ideas that make
up a work, to which it does *not* apply.The reason for this is essential and unavoidable, and must
be stated clearly and unequivocally at this juncture:
information is free.  It's not that it *wants* to be -- it
*is* and it always has been.  This fact is unassailable,
however, unless we let come to pass a world that subscribes
to ""universal content control"" for the sake of so-called
""moral rights"" implemented at the behest of narrow content
industry interests.TCPA and Palladium are initiatives that hope to encourage
the general public, and more specifically producers of
information products in general, to identify content control
with ""moral rights,"" blithely overlooking the real
implications of information technology in a free society,
and the long tradition of American jurisprudence upholding
the freedom intrinsic to information, a freedom on which the
prospects of information technology crucially depend.Seth Johnson-- [CC] Counter-copyright:

"Folks,
 
my first time posting - have a bit of Unix experience, but am new to Linux. 
Just got a new PC at home - Dell box with Windows XP. Added a second hard disk
for Linux. Partitioned the disk and have installed Suse 7.2 from CD, which went
fine except it didn't pick up my monitor.
 
I have a Dell branded E151FPp 15"" LCD flat panel monitor and a nVidia GeForce4
Ti4200 video card, both of which are probably too new to feature in Suse's default
set. I downloaded a driver from the nVidia website and installed it using RPM.
Then I ran Sax2 (as was recommended in some postings I found on the net), but
it still doesn't feature my video card in the available list. What next?
 
Another problem. I have a Dell branded keyboard and if I hit Caps-Lock twice,
the whole machine crashes (in Linux, not Windows) - even the on/off switch is
inactive, leaving me to reach for the power cable instead.
 
If anyone can help me in any way with these probs., I'd be really grateful -
I've searched the 'net but have run out of ideas.
 
Or should I be going for a different version of Linux such as RedHat? Opinions
welcome.
 
Thanks a lot,
Peter--

"fw : western energy markets stuggle along - cera monthly briefing latest western markets forecaset from cambridge energy . lorna - - - - - original message - - - - - from : webmaster @ cera . com @ enron sent : friday , january 26 , 2001 2 : 50 pm to : insights @ cera . com subject : western energy markets stuggle along - cera monthly briefing title : western energy markets stuggle along url : http : / / www 20 . cera . com / eprofile ? u = 35 indeed , the pressure is intensifying . the credit crisis precipitated by the power market crisis is spilling over into gas markets ; storage levels within california are again at critically low levels . the mild weather during december and early january allowed some improvement in the positions , but when pg some plants have simply curtailed operations in response to the higher prices . on the power side , plants within california are extremely limited in their ability to burn alternative fuels because of emissions credits . however , plants outside of california do have some backup capability . arizona public service has purchased 400 , 000 barrels of 1 % sulfur residual fuel oil to burn as an alternative to gas . given the intense pressure on gas , oil will absorb some of growth in power loads . california in november an early strong draw on storage in california raised questions about winter deliverability within the state . a combination of low storage inventories , high gas demand for power generation , and continued high utilization rates on import pipelines into the state will keep pressure on california prices through february ( see table 6 ) . despite efforts by end users to limit gas burns in the state in the face of extremely high gas prices , cera expects demand during january in the state is up by 650 mmcf per day on a year - over - year basis . in february , loads should start to decline as residential and commercial demand declines through the month . however , power loads will remain strong and actually climb from january into february as hydroelectric generation falls . this demand support , continued strong capacity utilization rates in import pipelines into california , and critically low storage inventories will keep intense pressure on gas prices within the state through february . during periods of high demand , prices will likely reach back up into the $ 15 . 00 to $ 20 . 00 per mmbtu range . eventually , as heating loads settle and storage draws slow toward the end of february , differentials should ease back into the $ 1 . 00 to $ 3 . 00 per mmbtu range . on balance , cera expects a topock differential for february of $ 3 . 00 per mmbtu ( see table 7 ) . pacific northwest three factors have combined to strengthen malin prices over the past week , and these forces should extend price strength at malin into february . first , the return of colder winter weather after moderate temperatures during late december and early january is increasing heating loads and power loads . second , lower - than - normal hydroelectric generation is increasing the draw on gas for power generation during a season when the pull is normally low . third , the california power shortage is drawing on all regional supplies and supporting the demand for gas for power generation . pacific northwest demand is expected to hold flat relative to january levels during february with slight increases in gas demand for power generation offsetting declines in residential and commercial demand . the sustained high demand levels  * despite relatively healthy northwest storage inventory levels  * will keep malin prices well above henry hub prices . cera expects a malin to henry hub differential of $ 1 . 00 per mmbtu during february . a drop - off in demand of 200 mmcf per day is expected in march , as steep declines in heating loads offset continued increases in gas demand for power generation . however , prices at malin will likely remain unusually strong this spring . part of the shortfall in hydroelectric generation continues to be made up by draining reservoirs . that early drawdown will limit the availability of hydroelectric generation through the spring and early summer months . both low hydroelectric generation and a challenging storage refill season in northern california should sustain the malin premium to the henry hub even into the spring . rocky mountains the volatility in rocky mountain differentials continues . differentials continue to depend primarily on local heating loads ; cooler weather supports loads and prices within the region , but periods of warm weather drive steep declines in rocky mountain prices relative to prices at the henry hub . during february , demand should drop off in the region . although declines in heating loads in neighboring western regions will be offset by increases in gas demand for power generation , the rockies remain primarily coal based . as a result , the lower expected hydroelectric output will do little to support loads within the region . increases in supply  * cera expects supply increases of 300 mmcf per day during 2001 relative to 2000  * will overwhelm available pipeline capacity out of the region . demand during february in the rockies is expected to remain flat at 2 . 9 bcf per day ; however , within the month demand loads will drop substantially . this will put pressure on differentials toward the end of the month , and cera expects average basis differentials to the henry hub during february of $ 0 . 75 per mmbtu . that widening trend should continue during march , with differentials to the henry hub eventually reaching $ 2 . 00 per mmbtu this summer . southwest prices in the san juan basin have been following rocky mountain prices up and down with regional demand loads . that dynamic will likely continue through february . cera expects relatively flat demand during february within the southwest . as in the west as a whole , a significant drop - off is expected during march as residential and commercial heating demand wanes . for february , continued strong demand loads within the rockies and southwest will support prices in the san juan , barring unusually warm weather . cera expects a differential to the henry hub of $ 0 . 65 per mmbtu . as residential and commercial loads decline sharply during late february and march , prices in the san juan will reflect ample supply . cera expects declines in san juan production during 2001 , but declines will be limited by the strongest drilling activity for conventional supplies in the basin in a decade . however , pressure on rocky mountain supplies will mean increased exports from the north into the san juan , and those increased exports will more than offset the declines in local production . pipeline capacity constraints out of the san juan will again mean wide san juan - to - henry hub differentials , with pressure on prices developing during the spring and intensifying through the summer months . western canada : increasing supply aeco differentials to the henry hub have ranged between $ 0 . 60 per mmbtu and over $ 1 . 00 per mmbtu . given strong demand in the united states , export pipelines have been running near capacity all winter . even the 1 . 3 bcf per day alliance pipeline has been running full ; through the end of the winter , continued strong us demand should keep export pipeline flows near capacity . given these flow levels , cera expects differentials to remain near the $ 0 . 60 to $ 1 . 00 per mmbtu level , reflecting the cost of transport on transcanada , the only available export capacity out of alberta . for february , cera expects a differential between aeco and the henry hub of $ 0 . 65 per mmbtu . storage inventories in western canada are running below historical average levels , but the refill season should be manageable ; inventories are nowhere near as low as us inventory levels . inventories in the west are expected to fall slightly below historical average levels by the end of withdrawal season , and exports should decline relative to first quarter levels as injection season begins in the spring . cera expects differentials to henry hub prices to narrow sometime in the late spring as the focus in alberta turns from filling us winter demand to refilling canadian storage . on the supply side , production has turned the corner in western canada , and year - over - year increases in supply of nearly 300 mmcf per day are now evident . after flat production levels for 2000 relative to 1999 , increases for the year 2001 should reach 350 mmcf per day . given strong expected demand from california and the west coast , cera expects no declines in year - over - year flows into the west on pge gt nw . overall flows should reach 2 . 4 bcf per day for 2001 , an increase of 85 mmcf per day from 2000 levels . * * end * * follow above url for full report . come shoot the rapids with us at ceraweek 2001 , "" shooting the rapids : strategies and risks for the energy future "" in houston , february 12 - 16 , 2001 ! for more information and to register , please visit http : / / www 20 . cera . com / ceraweek / e - mail category : monthly briefing cera knowledge area ( s ) : western energy , to make changes to your cera . com account go to : forgot your username and password ? go to : http : / / www 20 . cera . com / client / forgot this electronic message and attachments , if any , contain information from cambridge energy research associates , inc .

"http://www.therockalltimes.co.uk/2002/04/08/new-tags.htmlW3C approves HTML 4 'emotitags' - Now you'll be able to say it with
feeling
by Lester HainesThe World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has approved a number of new html
'emotitags' which will revolutionise the web surfing experience.The tags have no physical effect, but rather elicit a strong emotional
response from the reader. Top of the list is  (War on TerrorT). The
tag, when judiciously applied, will immediately provoke violent anger
against ragheads, thus:Charity agencies report that Iraqi leader Sadaam Hussein has
adopted the African dictatorial habit of eating his political
opponents.Of particular interest to British code-monkeys is the new  (I'm
hurting too). This is designed for use when reporting on the life of
Elizabeth the Queen Mother and other recently dead famous people:She touched our lives in so many ways with her common touch and her
instinctive understanding of ordinary people. She will be sadly
missed.The instantaneous effect is to reduce the reader to teary-eyed and
self-indulgent wallowing in which he or she becomes unaccountably upset
about the death of a complete stranger.Political reporting also looks to benefit from the new  tag. Any
government ministerial pronouncement is thus rendered immediately
transparent:Tony Blair was quick to defend transport secretary Byers, calling
him ""the most honest man it has been my privilege to know"".And, in a much-needed boost to satire sites, W3C has formally ratified
the controversial . This guarantees any text contained within
it complete immunity from prosecution:Naomi Campbell, we can confirm, is a talentless, drug-addicted
perjurer who believes that good looks alone can justify her appalling
and obnoxious behaviour.The new tags have been warmly received by the programming community. W3C
has, however, warned that they are to be used economically. It has
further cautioned that they should never be used together, since the
effect on the reader could be catastrophic:In response to reports that the Queen Mother had fallen
victim to Sadaam Hussein's Axis of EvilT chemical weapons programme,
Stephen Byers noted: ""She was everybody's favourite grandmother who
touched the lives of billions. The only consolation we can gain from
this tragedy is that all of the UK's trains will be running on time by
next Monday. And you can quote me on that.""http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork

"Dear Sir, 
With due respect and humility I write you this letter which I believe you
would
be of great assistance to my children and I.
I got your contact through my husband commercial address book and believed
that
you must be a trust worthy and reliable person that will not like to
intimidate me
or betray my trust after hearing this news. I am a native of KONOBO in the
KEREMA
local district of SIERRA LEONE in West Africa and the wife of Late DR.
MUNDI A.
KOJO who was assassinated by the rebel forced loyal to Major John Paul
Koromah
because he was the Director General National Gold and Diamond Mining
Corporation
of Sierra Leone. Few days before my husband was assassinated, he 
instructed me
and my children (Ibrahim and Amina) to move out of Sierra Leone immediately,
before the powerful Economic community of West African States (ECOMOG)
forces
intervened, which eventually resulted into a brutal civil war. My children
and I
managed to escape to Togo through the help of my husband's friend. We came
into
Togo with some valuables including a cash sum of $25MILLION(TWENTY FIVE
MILLION
UNITED STATES DOLLARS ONLY) in two trunks boxes which I have deposited
with a
Trust Company here in Togo and special arrangement has been made with the
currier
company who will freight the money to your country.
Meanwhile, I want to leave Togo entirely with this money for investment in
your
country because of a stable political situation there and mostly for the
future of
my children. I want you to please assist us to claim this fund from the
Trust
Company in any of their branches in Europe, after which the fund will be
deposited
into your account for investment in your country. You should also help us to
source for good investment opportunity so that we can invest wisely in your
country when the fund is finally confirmed in your account.
We have it in mind to reward you handsomely for your assistance as we have
resolved to give you 20% of the total sum for your help. But due to how I
am being
monitored by the Sierra Leonean Government Secret Agents, I will advice
you to
have the 
deal concluded with my son (IBRAHIM KOJO). Please contact my son on this

More so in countries where the cost of a proprietorial office suite could eat up six months or more of the average citizen's earnings.United Nation's Development Programme's Ms. Radhika Lal , a Information-Communication Technology Policy Advisor, recently drew attention to a conference on Open Source for E-Government. It is to be held in Washington, DC on October 17-18.infoDev, the Cyberspace Policy Institute of The George Washington University, and the UNDP are jointly behind this event. It is intended to draw participants from local, national and international organizations from both the public and private sector.This meet intends to present cases of 'best practices', raise awareness about the potential of open source and free software for e-governance. More importantly, it will be sharing experiences among policy makers, donors, users and consumers, universities, and industry specialists in Open Source, e-Government and related fields.Ms Lal works at the ICT-for-Development's Special Initiative Bureau for Development Policy at the UNDP's East 45th Street offices in New York.ICT-for-development is a campaign to use more of infotech and the Internet for global development and fighting problems like poverty and illiteracy. But despite quite a few shared goals and concerns with the GNU/Linux world, so far little networking has been done between these two separate circles.See http://www.egovos.org/OTHER ARMS OF THE U.N. ======================Besides, the UNDP, other arms of the United Nations are also known to be showing increasing interest in the potential of free software/open source tools. Paris-headquartered Unesco (United Nations Education, Scientific and Cultural Organisation) recently launched its own Free Software portal. It's at http://www.unesco.org/webworld/portal_freesoft.UNESCO's Jean-Claude Dauphin of the Information Society Division also announced that this international organisation has been looking out for contributors with a good knowledge of the Free Software movement in relation with UNESCO fields of competence -- education, science and culture.It zeroed in particularly on those coming from the Third World (also called the 'South' countries) who could could make propositions for ""revising, updating and extending the UNESCO Free Software Portal"" as well as for including new basic documents. ""This work could be done using a fee or consultant contract and the fee can be discussed depending on the amount of work described in the contract,"" said Dauphin. Check out the sites atUNESCO Libraries Portal (http://www.unesco.org/webworld/portal_bib/) UNESCO Archives Portal (http://www.unesco.org/webworld/portal_archives/) UNESCO Free Software Portal (http://www.unesco.org/webworld/portal_freesoft/) UNESCO Observatory on the Information Society (http://www.unesco.org/webworld/observatory/)NEW TOOLS FOR CDS/ISIS ======================Recently, Unesco also announced the launch of new tools for data exchange from and to its CDS/ISIS software. These two new tools -- ImpExp2709 and IsisAscii v 0.92 -- have recently been released for data exchange from and to UNESCO's software package CDS/ISIS. CDS/ISIS is a generalized information storage and retrieval system that is freely distributed, and has attracted users in places like libraries within the Third World. The new utilities have been released with their source code (GPL license). See http://www.unesco.org/webworld/news/2002/020806_isis.shtmlMeanwhile, UNDP's APDIP (Asia-Pacific Development Information Programme) based in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, is also learnt to be thinking seriously about organizing some kind of a consultation on open source, GNU/Linux and related issues.""We want to see how we can further this cause in the region,"" APDIP's Shahid Akhtar told this correspondent.Niranjan Rajani , of Pakistani origin but based in the birthplace of Linux, Finland, is now working on a research project on ""Significance of Free/OpenSource Software for Developing Countries"".This project is financed by the Finnish Foreign Ministry, and he has undertaken to write the paper by the end of November this year, for Maailma.Net, a local division of OneWorld.Net.This project's goal is to find out, evaluate and analyze the extent of use of FS/OSS, especially some of its most significant and popular projects; GNU/Linux, Apache, Mozilla, OpenOffice etc. in the developing or Third World countries. It will also look at its possible impact on economies, societies and lives of these countries.CONVINCING GOVERNMENTS ======================In India, organisations like Red Hat have been putting out slick presentations to convince governments and officials to try out Open Source. Shift over boldly to the world of 'open source' and 'free' software. That's the message that governments across India were recently with, as official computerisation efforts get bogged down due to spiraling software costs and speedy software-fuelled hardware obsolence.Senior IT and e-governance officials from across the country tuned in attentively during a recent seminar in Goa, as executives from computing giant IBM and leading Linux systems supplier Red Hat India narrated long lists of benefits that governments could get from going the Linux way.Pointing to examples from across the globe, Red Hat India argued that the US Department of Energy has built supercomputers on GNU/Linux, the Chinese are making Linux the official server operating system -- to be widely used in varsities, military installations and within government. Some months back, an organisation under India's Ministry of Information Technology -- called the ER&DCI (Electronics Research and Development Centre of India) -- entered into a strategic alliance with leading Linux systems supplier Red Hat India to popularize the 'open source' solution in the government sector.On networks like the EDC/World Bank-support GKD (Global Knowledge for Development), issues of free software and open source often make it to the news.GNU/Linux is a suitable tool in organising too, as it was recently pointed out. (See http://www.lincproject.org)""The Low Income Networking and Communication (LINC) Project of the Welfare Law Center has helped many low-income led organizing groups acquire access to the Internet and use technology more effectively,"" says Dirk Slater . While these groups have increased their abilities to communicate with one another and their allies by using the Internet, one communication hurdle remains -- communicating with their leadership via the Internet. Despite many ""digital divide"" initiatives addressing access to the Internet in low-income communities, access is still an issue. Public Internet access points, such as libraries and schools, are not sufficient, as Slater has pointed out. Many low-income leaders do not have access to the Internet where it would make the most impact -- in their homes. LINC argues that the need for Internet communication is particularly great for rural groups whose members live far apart and cannot have frequent face-to-face meetings because of distance, time and money constraints.""We began to explore the idea of using Linux, a free operating system that works well on older computers, when we learned of Microsoft's decision to discontinue support of its older operating systems like Windows 95< according to Slater, who is 'senior circuit rider' for the Low-Income Networking and Communications (LINC) Project at the Welfare Law Center.LINC protagonists say they had also been ""troubled"" by the frequent problems that occur for Windows users just by having Windows run on its own. ""Giving a person who lives in a rural area an older computer with Windows seemed like we were just asking for trouble. We also attempted to identify similar projects but had limited success,"" says Slater. LINC wanted to increase its ability to provide stable desktop systems using donated computers for board members and leaders of low-income led organizations that LINC serves. ""Our goal is to increase the ability of LINC Project partner groups to use open-source software to support their organizing work. We also wanted to document the project as much as we possibly could, so we could provide details of our experiences for others doing similar projects,"" LINC explains.LINC identified a partner in Grass Roots Organizing in Mexico, MO, and installed GNU/Linux on 10 computers used as stand-alone workstations in people's homes. GNU/Linux was also installed on a brand new stand-alone computer to work as the main computer in the GRO office.Links were built with the Mizzou Linux Users Group for ongoing local support.""We still have a long way to go before we can call this a completely successful project. After a period of a few months we will assess whether the board members are actually using the computers to communicate more effectively,"" said Slater.To view the daily journals on the project with GRO please visit the LINC Project Linux pages at NEED TO NETWORK ===============Bala Pillai , who was earlier based in Malaysia and now in Sydney-Australia, is founder of Tamil Innaiyam (http://www.tamil.net), an organisation to promote the Tamil language worldwide. He points to the impact GNU/Linux is making in some distant areas of the Third World.Says Pillai: ""The most interactive open source/Linux community in our time zone/Asia springs out of the Philippines. Primarily because the Filipino psyche is a more secure psyche, a more self-confident psyche. ""Folks who are self-confident worry about the future less, and allocate more time diagnosing and solving problems rather than echoing and re-echoing it. Filipinos are also more into sharing and online sharing -- we should look to more symbiosis with them,"" says he. Pillai also notes that the Manila-based Miguel Paraz, whom he interacted with since 1996, is a key catalyst in the Filipino Linux community. ""http://www.q-linux.com is a good starting point to get a feel for the key Open Source catalysts in the Philippines,"" says he. Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia-based Dinesh who runs http://www.alphaque.com is another lead Open Source catalyst from the region, explains Pillai. ""Do look for symbiosis opportunities there too,"" he suggests. ""I see lots of room for us to symbiosis together. For example, there is likely to be areas where we diagnosing, documenting, analyzing, coding or publicizing where there is over-duplication. If we coordinated ourselves and found out where our circles and priorities intersect , we could share this work and get fruits out faster,"" he adds. -- Frederick Noronha * Freelance Journalist * Goa * India 832.409490 / 409783 BYTESFORALL www.bytesforall.org * GNU-LINUX http://linuxinindia.pitas.com Email fred@bytesforall.org * Mobile +9822 122436 (Goa) * Saligao Goa India Writing with a difference... on what makes *the* difference ########################################################################## # Send submissions for comp.os.linux.announce to: cola@stump.algebra.com # # PLEASE remember a short description of the software and the LOCATION. # # This group is archived at http://stump.algebra.com/~cola/ # ########################################################################## ------------------------------From: Frederick Noronha Subject: Attn programmers: support offered [FLOSS-Sarai Initiative] Date: 8 Sep 2002 01:25:45 GMTDear friends,Can we manage to get some money into backing Free/Libre Open Source Software initiatives, that would help young volunteers out there to support their cash-strapped initiatives? Sarai.net, a Delhi-based initiative under the CSDS (Centre for the Study of Developing Societies) has been solidly supportive of such an idea.Jeebesh Bagchi sent in this offer recently. It could surely be of help particularly to college students and others wanting to make a break in Free Software/Open Source, but hamstrung by resources. It might help if projects are initially kept small and definitely workable, I guess. This is my own gut-level feeling, but maybe bigger initiatives which are clearly workable could also prove convincing. If such experiments prove useful, maybe there would be a good case for greater support to free software/open source developers in regions like ours. --FN ========== Forwarded message ==========The Sarai Programme, Centre for the Study of Developing Societies, Delhi (www.sarai.net) invites applications for Support Grants to projects in the area of Free Software, Open Source Software and Social Usage of SoftwareSarai invites programmers (practictioners as well as students) to propose projects in the area of free and open source software applications relevant to educational, social and community needs.

Polite and respectful protest is acceptable then. No dumping tea in the 
harbour or anything like that.
I think the primary purpose of loud and rowdy protests is to get on 
television, and that the tactics can be
justified as a reaction to a systematic removal of alternative 
viewpoints from that medium. On the other hand,
it was a priceless TV moment. There was nothing resembling assault, and 
the protestors were not in anybody's face
(at least in my understanding of the vernacular).And no, being rude and disrespectful is not the way to influence 
politicians, but the standard way of using lobbyists and
writing checks is beyond many of us.Owen",Safe Email

#
# French Writer Tried As Anti-Islam, Protest Erupts
# By Caroline Brothers
#
# PARIS (Reuters) - Provocative French novelist Michel Houellebecq
# faced a Paris court on Tuesday for allegedly inciting racial hatred
# by calling Islam ""the stupidest religion"" and its holy book the
# Koran a depressing read.
#
# The case, brought against him by four Muslim groups, is a cause
# celebre reminiscent of the Salman Rushdie affair, pitting freedom of
# expression against religious sensitivities.
#
# The Muslim groups, which include the Mecca-based World Islamic
# League and the Paris Mosque, accuse the writer of insulting Islam in
# an interview with the literary magazine ""Lire"" during last year's
# launch of his novel ""Plateforme.""
#
# Lire is also on trial over the remarks, which have taken on an added
# significance in France in the atmosphere of heightened sensitivity
# and concern about Islam following the September 11 attacks by Muslim
# radicals in the United States.
#
# Shortly after the trial started, 11 people in the courtroom stripped
# off their shirts to reveal T-shirts saying ""No to the censure of the
# imams"" and ""Marianne veiled, Marianne raped"" -- a reference to the
# female symbol of the French republic.
#
# ""Freedom of expression! freedom of expression!"" they and other
# Houellebecq supporters chanted after they were thrown out of the
# courtroom at the main law courts in central Paris.
#
# While intellectuals argued before the trial that Houellebecq should
# be free to write what he wants, Lyon Mosque rector Kamel Kabtan
# retorted: ""We are for freedom of expression, but not for insulting
# communities.""
#
# BETE NOIRE
#
# Houellebecq, 45, the bete noire of contemporary French literature,
# is no stranger to controversy. He offended conservatives and the
# politically correct left with his 1998 novel ""Les Particules
# Elementaires"" (""Atomised"" in English).
#
# Paris Mosque rector Dalil Boubakeur says Muslims have been insulted
# once before by Houellebecq, who had the main character in Plateforme
# admit he felt ""a quiver of glee"" every time a ""Palestinian
# terrorist"" was killed.
#
# The World Islamic League, the Lyon Mosque and the National
# Federation of Muslims in France have joined the Paris Mosque in
# bringing Houellebecq to trial.
#
# France's Human Rights League joined them as a civil party, saying
# Houellebecq's comments amounted to ""Islamophobia"" and deserved to be
# sanctioned as part of the league's struggle against discrimination
# and racism.
#
# The Paris Mosque has hired Jean-Marc Varaut, one of France's leading
# trial lawyers, whose past clients include Maurice Papon, the former
# official condemned in 1998 for Nazi-era crimes against humanity for
# sending Jews to death camps.
#
# RESTORING BLASPHEMY?
#
# Houellebecq's lawyer Emmanuel Pierrat argues that the case
# effectively re-establishes the notion of blasphemy, despite the fact
# that France as a secular state has no such law, and says
# Houellebecq's opponents want to deny him freedom of expression.
#
# He also argues that the interview in Lire truncated a six-hour
# conversation and Houellebecq was not given the chance to approve the
# article before it appeared.
#
# Houellebecq's publisher Flammarion has distanced itself from the
# author, whose comments some say may have cost him France's
# prestigious Goncourt prize -- for which he had been a contender.
#
# The novelist, who lives outside Cork, Ireland, writes in a detached
# style about a bleak world in which people have forgotten how to
# love.
#
# Translated into 25 languages, ""Atomised"" incensed France's 1968
# generation with its scathing descriptions of the hippie era but won
# him France's November prize in 1998 and the Impac award, one of the
# world's biggest fiction prizes.
#
# Losing his case may mean a year in jail or a $51,000 fine.- Gordon

original libvorbis rpm and the new one. Remove the old one, then do: rpm -Uvh libvorbis-* RPM then assumes that you want both versions installed at the same time,
and does so. Why you can't do this after you have one library already

"" he added that the davis / socal mou is dead and that all the "" plan b ' s "" are "" speculative "" at best . he also thought that socal was being "" naive if they thought they would get a better deal from the legislature than from the bankruptcy court . "" 2 . bond issuance - $ 12 b not enough angelides conceded that a $ 12 b bond issue would not be enough to buy power for the summer and that the true costs would probably be $ 18 - 24 b . the only reason they didn ' t issue more is that angelides felt that "" $ 12 b was all the market could handle . "" the current game plan for bonds assumes an average peak price for power of $ 400 / mwh , which angelides said explains the difference between his estimates and the higher estimates from state comptroller ' s kathleen connell ' s office . 3 . new generator construction anglelides was explicit that the california public power authority ( authorized by the legislature last week ) will "" build plants and not stop until we [ california ] has a 10 - 15 % capacity cushion above expected demand . angelides expects the state to be "" 5 - 10 % short on power all summer .

with the definitions, then I'd have to say that I myself am a
genetically engineered organism.  But I'm natural, baby.  My parents
were attracted to each other's phenotypes, mixed some genes in the
hopes that those genotypes would get in there, and grew me around
them.  Sure, they engineered the process when they selected each
other.  But they didn't engineer the genetics.  If genetic enginering
wasn't such an important topic today, it wouldn't be such an important
distinction.I guess that the reason that I disagree is that some groups arguing
against any checks on genetic engineering use that same argument -

"re : lng may 19 decision vince - thanks for the update . what i am not sure of is what if any decision has to be made on may 19 . it seems to me that the mystic lady and elba island deals have already been approved and executed - but it is quite likely i am missing a detail or two . john vince j kaminski 15 / 05 / 2000 17 : 14 to : john sherriff / lon / ect @ ect cc : vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect , david gorte / hou / ect @ ect , rick buy / hou / ect @ ect , ted murphy / hou / ect @ ect subject : re : lng may 19 decision john , this is the update on what i have done for the lng transactions . 1 . i was not involved in the lng ship project . i shall read the dash and give you my comments . without looking at the details , i think that the decision to charter a tanker removes one significant risk we have at the elba island project ( please , see point 2 ) . 2 . elba island . i am working with doug rotenberbg , brad hitch , scott earnest ( sally beck ' s organization ) and rac to set up the book for the elba island transaction . the next step will be to expand the book to capture all the enron ' s lng - related positions in one place and to look for natural risk offsets and possible hedges . a working group is meeting to close a few remaining gaps tomorrow ( tuesday ) at 8 : 30 . a few comments on the book design and my view of the project : a . the current thinking is that lng will be sourced for the elba island facility by buying marginal cargos on the fob basis . marginal cargos will represent supply from excess capacity that has not been committed under long - term contracts or became available due to some short - term frictions . the fob cargos are typically selling at a significant discount to the long - term contract prices . the economics of the deal , as represented by the book we are setting up , will reflect the assumption that not only we can locate marginal cargos but that we shall be able to do it on a regular basis , arranging shipping and coordinating the facility schedule and natural gas transactions in the us . in other words , we have a significant logistical and operational risk in this transaction . b . the transaction will cover the period of 17 years ( with an extension option of 5 years ) . even if we can lock - in the lng volumes over this time period , we have no ability to lock - in the other side of the spread ( us gas prices ) for such a long tenor . this is essentially a tolling transaction with exposure to the lng - nat gas spread and i would not recommend locking - in only one leg of the spread . one solution would be to cover , let ' s say , 50 % of he lng volumes for the first 5 years and lock - in the nat gas side on the us market side . c . the book we are setting up will be based on many managerial assumptions regarding sources of lng , shipping rates , schedules , etc . i would set up a big prudence reserve in case we mark it to market . d . my group will work on valuation of some options we have in the elba island deal ( that are good for enron ) and on the hedging strategy for the lng positions . long - term lng contracts are typically based on the japanese crude cocktail that correlates very well with brent . vince john sherriff 05 / 14 / 2000 01 : 40 am to : vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect cc : lauren urquhart / lon / ect @ ect subject : lng may 19 decision vince i haven ' t spoken to you for awhile but hope the world is treating you well . anyway with greg moving to his new role i have ( i hope only temporarily ) staff trading oversight for the eastern hemishere plus lng . i understand that your group is taking a first cut at developing curves for lng and lng ship values . i also understand that another lng ship decision is on the dockets for may 19 ( not very far away ) . anway i understand this is a big decision but i still have gotten very little info yet . can you please let me know where you stand now ? i will ask my assistant lauren to set up a time that i can speak with you in the next couple of days and if you have anything for me to review before then she can get it faxed to me as well . look forward to connecting with you vince . john",Safe Email

u = 5526 & m = 1402 , alternative url : warm weather and strong storage injections have temporarily shifted the focus in the gas market away from a potential supply shortage this winter toward a growing sense that supplies might just prove adequate . the result has been a steady and steep decline in the november nymex price from $ 5 . 63 per mmbtu on october 12 into the $ 4 . 60 s as of october 25 . cash prices have followed suit , falling from the mid - $ 5 . 50 s to the $ 4 . 60 s at the henry hub , and gas is now pricing below residual fuel oil in the gulf coast and especially on the east coast . although gas storage inventories will begin the winter at levels higher than expected , in cera  , s view adequate supply for the winter is not yet assured , and the market remains subject to a quick return to prices well above $ 5 . 00 with the first cold snap . storage injections of 71 billion cubic feet ( bcf ) for the week ended october 20 accompanied by broad - based and continuing warm weather have driven the shift in market psychology . last week  , s injection rate was 26 . 5 bcf , or approximately 3 . 8 bcf per day , above the previous five - year average for those seven days and 58 bcf above the 13 bcf of injections recorded last year for the week ending october 22 . with warm weather this week and the return of more normal temperatures expected next week , cera now expects storage to reach a maximum level of 2 , 784 bcf on october 31 - - still an all - time low entering the winter , by 26 bcf ( see table 1 ) . is this inventory level "" enough "" ? not yet . storage inventories this winter under 15 - year normal weather conditions would fall to approximately 780 bcf , 22 bcf above the previous all - time low . this end - of - march minimum implies total withdrawals in the united states this winter of 2 . 0 trillion cubic feet ( tcf ) , 128 bcf above last year  , s withdrawals . but holding withdrawals this winter down to 2 . 0 tcf in the face of a return to normal weather - - and the demand rebound of 3 . 0 bcf per day it would bring - - will be difficult . although the beginning of a us supply rebound and growing imports will add approximately 1 . 0 bcf per day to supplies this winter , holding withdrawals down requires both of the following : * industrial markets - - mainly ammonia and methanol producers - - that are now shut down because of high gas prices must remain shut down . these markets represent approximately 0 . 5 bcf per day of demand that could return , should gas prices moderate relative to ammonia and methanol . * the nearly 1 . 5 bcf per day of switchable load now burning residual fuel oil must remain off of gas . in cera  , s view , for gas prices to fall below resid on a sustained basis , particularly as power loads increase this winter , it must become apparent that winter demand can be met , the current resid load can return to gas , and storage inventories can be held reasonably near the previous record low . that low , 758 bcf , occurred in march 1996 and was accompanied by a february average price of $ 4 . 41 and a march average of $ 3 . 00 at the henry hub . that spring , however , us productive capability was nearly 4 . 0 bcf per day greater than it is today , winter power generation demand was lower , and there were about 4 . 5 million fewer residential and commercial gas customers in the united states . market fundamentals in cera  , s view still support gas prices above those of resid , which as of this writing is pricing in the $ 4 . 75 - $ 5 . 00 per mmbtu range . warm weather throughout november and into december could reverse this relationship , but a warm october alone is insufficient , and any cold weather within the next few weeks will quickly tighten the slack that has temporarily come into the market . cera  , s price outlook for november - - an average of $ 5 . 50 at the henry hub - - stands for now . * * end * * follow url for pdf version of this alert with associated table . cera ' s autumn 2000 roundtable event dates and agendas are now available at http : / / www . cera . com / event account changes to edit your personal account information , including your e - mail address , etc . go to : http : / / eprofile . cera . com / cfm / edit / account . cfm this electronic message and attachments , if any , contain information from cambridge energy research associates , inc .

Thanks for that.  I'd sort of suspected that if it was a widespread
problem it would have already been fixed.  Starting to look more likely
it is a mistake/misconfiguration on my part, though I still don't know
where to look for the mistake/misconfiguration.

doesn't matter as much as if the official law does not conform to the
facts on the ground.If you don't match the law to the facts on the ground, you wind up with
a two-tier society (De Soto's Bell Jar).  Worse, the massive evasion of
the official law encourages the corruption you speak of.In some countries, the agencies in charge of registering property also
arrange for illegal living arrangements for their employees.  They do
this because even the people who run the system can't make it work for
people they care about.

The United States has a program, called Diversity Immigrant Visa
Lottery (better known as the Green Card Lottery), making available
each year by random selection 50,000 permanent residence visas
(Green Cards) to people from around the world. The objective of the
program is to issue Green Cards to individuals born in countries with
historically low levels of immigration to the United States.
A Green Card is a Permanent Residence Visa of the U.S.A. A Green Card
will give you legal right to work and live permanently in the United
States. Green Card holders receive health, education, and several other
benefits. If you win a Green Card, you can apply for U.S. Citizenship at
a later time. The Green Card does not affect your present citizenship.
You and your family could be lucky winners!

COCKLES OF ONE'S HEART  You may recall that I was a bit suspicious
of the story I told in last week's issue. James Woodfield pointed
out that there is another possible explanation. In medieval Latin,
the ventricles of the heart were at times called ""cochleae cordis"",
where the second word is derived from ""cor"", heart. Those unversed
in Latin could have misinterpreted ""cochleae"" as ""cockles"". Oddly,
""cochlea"" in Latin means ""snail"" (from the shape of the ventricles
- it's also the name of the spiral cavity of the inner ear), so if
this story is right we should really be speaking of warming the
snails of one's heart.SERRANCIFIED  Many of you supplied your own memories of this odd
expression that I tried to make sense of last week. Taken together,
they show that the expression is best known in Canada and that it
was originally something like ""My sufficiency has been suffonsified
and anything additional would be superfluous"". That form of the
word is the one that is most common in online searches, where the
Canadian focus is also obvious. Cheryl Caesar noted that it appears
in a passage in Margaret Atwood's novel, ""Cat's Eye"": she has two
teenage girls living in Toronto in the 1940s who say, ""Are you
sufficiently sophonisified?"". A Vancouver restaurant reviewer has
the pen name ""Sufficiently Suffonsified"". Oddly, there's also a
1999 record by the Austrian band Cunning Dorx entitled ""Paradigms
Suffonsified"". G H Gordon Paterson suggested that the word might be
a punning blend of ""sufficient"" and ""fancified"". There are some
tantalising suggestions that it may actually be Scots, and not New
World at all.ABSQUATULATE  I have been gently remonstrated with for describing
""sockdologer"" as one of the products of early American linguistic
inventiveness that hasn't survived to the present day. Many people
gave me examples of current or recent use. I stand corrected.
2. Turns of Phrase: Thinspiration
-------------------------------------------------------------------
This is one of the key words associated with a deeply disquieting
online trend. In the past couple of years or so a number of Web
sites and chatrooms have appeared which actively promote anorexia
nervosa (known on the sites as ""ana"") and other eating disorders as
lifestyle choices. Since 90% of anorexics are young women, these
""pro-ana"" sites are usually run by and attract that group (one term
sometimes used for them is ""weborexics""). Sites offer suggestions
on how to become and remain thin, often through tips on avoiding
eating, and how to disguise the condition from family and friends.
Other themes sometimes featured on such sites are self-mutilation
(""cutting"") and bulimia (""mia""). Thin women, such as supermodels
and Calista Flockhart, are presented as ""thinspirations"", examples
to emulate. Sites have had names such as Starving for Perfection,
Wasting Away on the Web and Dying To Be Thin. Medical professionals
in the US and UK are deeply concerned about them, because they
accentuate the low self-regard of young women, who are particularly
prone to eating disorders, put their lives at risk, and discourage
them from facing their illness and seeking treatment for it.The Internet is home to a number of pro-eating disorder Web sites -
- places where sufferers can discuss tips, trade low-calorie
recipes and exchange poems and art that may be used as ""triggers""
or so-called ""thinspiration.""
                                         [""Calgary Sun"", Feb. 2002]A new trend among young adults has been sweeping the nation: pro-
anorexia Web sites. Also known as pro-ana, these sites glorify
anorexia nervosa and offer ""thinspiration"" on maintaining a
starvation lifestyle.

3. Weird Words: Usufructuary  /ju:zjU'frVktju:@rI/
-------------------------------------------------------------------
A person who has the use or enjoyment of something, especially
property.We are short of words that contain four u's. Among the few that are
even relatively common (leaving aside the Hawaiian ""muu-muu"") are
""tumultuously"" and ""unscrupulous"", although some rare words like
""pustulocrustaceous"" and ""pseudotuberculous"" are also recorded.The term comes from Roman law. ""Usufruct"" is the right of temporary
possession or enjoyment of something that belongs to somebody else,
so far as that can be done without causing damage or changing its
substance. For example, a slave in classical Rome could not own
anything. Things he acquired as the result of his labour he merely
held ""usus (et) fructus"", under ""use (and) enjoyment"" - it was his
master who actually owned them.The term remains in use in modern US legal practice and elsewhere.
These days a ""usufructuary"" can be a trustee who enjoys the income
from property he holds in trust for somebody else. Many Native
American groups hold land on a ""usufruct"" basis, with rights to
enjoy the renewable natural resources of the land for hunting and
fishing.
4. Q&A
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. How does the term ""three sheets to the wind"" denote drunkenness?
[Benjamin Weatherston]A. It's a sailor's expression.We ignorant landlubbers might think that a sheet is a sail, but in
traditional sailing-ship days, a ""sheet"" was actually a rope,
particularly one attached to the bottom corner of a sail (it comes
from an Old English term for the corner of a sail). The sheets were
vital, since they trimmed the sail to the wind. If they ran loose,
the sail would flutter about in the wind and the ship would wallow
off its course out of control.Extend this idea to sailors on shore leave, staggering back to the
ship after a good night on the town, well tanked up. The irregular
and uncertain locomotion of the jolly seafarers must have reminded
onlookers of the way a ship moved in which the sheets were loose.
Perhaps one loose sheet might not have been enough to get the image
across, so the saying became ""three sheets to the wind"".Our first written example comes from that recorder of low life,
Pierce Egan, in his ""Real life in London"" of 1821. But it must
surely be much older.                        -----------Q. My East End mother-in-law used to say she was ""well and truly
mogadored"" when she was puzzled by something. Any idea of
derivation and meaning? [Bryan]A. Now that's a bit of British slang I haven't heard in years,
though it is still around (Nanny Ogg uses it in one of Terry
Pratchett's Discworld fantasy stories, I am told). As you say, it
means that somebody is puzzled, confused, or ""all at sea"". It's
also sometimes spelled ""moggadored"", though it doesn't turn up in
print much in either spelling. (No relation to the British word
""moggy"" for a cat, by the way, which seems to be a pet form of
""Margaret"".)The writers of slang dictionaries are decidedly mogadored about its
origin. It looks very much like rhyming slang for ""floored"", which
is likewise slang, meaning dumbfounded or confused. But the dispute
arises over what the root is. Some say it is Irish, from ""magagh"",
to mock, jeer or laugh at, via an unrecorded intermediate form
""mogadÃ³i"".Others suggest that, like some other East End slang terms, it
derives from the Gypsy language Romany (Cockney slang is like
London itself, a melting pot, in which words from many sources are
amalgamated, including Yiddish and old-time forces slang derived
from languages around the world). In this case the source may be
""mokardi"" or ""mokodo"", something tainted (these Romany words also
provide the root for yet another slang phrase, ""to put the mockers
on something"", to jinx it).Sorry not to be able to be more definite!                        -----------Q. I was having an interesting discussion with an American
professor of business studies who also consults to industry. She
was recalling an unbudgeted initiative within a major software
corporate, which the UK managing director described as a ""skunk
project"". I have seen this epithet before, usually in the phrase
""skunk works"", meaning a semi-official project team that is tacitly
licensed to bend the rules and think outside the box. I wonder what
the derivation is? I don't think it can refer to the smelly wild
animal, but neither I think can it refer to the street term for a
strong variant of marijuana. Can you shed any light? [Martin
Hayman]A. We must start in Dogpatch, the fictional place in the backwoods
of upper New York State made famous between 1934 and 1977 as the
home of professional mattress tester Li'l Abner, in the comic strip
written and drawn by Al Capp. The original was actually ""Skonk
Works"", the place where Lonesome Polecat and Hairless Joe brewed
their highly illicit bootleg Kickapoo Joy Juice from ingredients
such as old shoes and dead skunks. (""Skonk"" is a dialect variant of
""skunk"".)We must now move to the very real Burbank, California. In 1943, a
small group of aeronautical engineers working for the then Lockheed
Aircraft Corporation (headed by Clarence ""Kelly"" Johnson) were
given the rush job of creating an entirely new plane from scratch,
the P-80 ""Shooting Star"" jet fighter. This they did in 143 days, 37
days ahead of schedule. Their secret project was housed in a
temporary structure roofed over with an old circus tent, which had
been thrown up next to a smelly plastics factory. The story goes
that one of the engineers answered the phone on a hot summer day
with the phrase ""Skonk Works here"" and the name stuck. It is also
said that Al Capp objected to their use of his term and it was
changed to Skunk Works.One division of the company, formally the Lockheed Martin Advanced
Development Program, is still known as the Skunk Works. The term
has been trademarked by Lockheed Martin, who have been aggressive
in protecting it.As a generic term, it dates from the 1960s. One definition is very
much that of the original and the one you describe: a small group
of experts who drop out of the mainstream of a company's operations
in order to develop some experimental technology or new application
in secrecy or at speed, unhampered by bureaucracy or the strict
application of regulations (Kelly Johnson formulated 14 visionary
rules for running such an operation, which are still regarded as
valid even now). It is also sometimes used for a similar group that
operates semi-illicitly, without top-level official knowledge or
support, though usually with the tacit approval of immediate
management.

How is this any different from attaching an Infobot or A.L.I.C.E
through licq's console-hook?  People have been doing that for years,
and for over a decade in IRC and the MUDs.... and the one thing I think we've learned in all that time is that,
as a help-desk, it doesn't work.  People just don't like talking to
robots, especially when the robots, once confused, become imbeciles.
I think the humans may feel cheated, deceived and tricked when they
discover, as with the Seattle answer, that they are talking to a
machine; there's no real intelligence behind that simulated-friendly
and therefore empty 'thx'.AIML is clever and cute, but for /practical/ applications as a first
line of technical support?  It's been tried over and over, and while I
/also/ think that it /should/ work, for the most part, people won't
use it.  What's worse, as we make the NL processing more and more
clever, it only means it fails more dramatically; ALICE doesn't just
stumble a bit, it starts to drool.  And ALICE is the best we have.Like a Dalek: All very impressive when things are going well, but all
it takes to betray the chicken-brain inside is a towel over it's
ill-placed eye, or a spin off the metal surface ;)In all the prolog-based NL database query systems of the 1980's and
other later chatterbot helpdesk projects like Shallow Red, even
simpler tries like Ask Jeeves, people very quickly know they're
talking to a robot, and the queries anneal to short, truncated and
terse database-like verb-noun or just noun-keyword requests.  People are just too quick to adapt, and too impatient to forgive a
clunky interface, and for now, especially when the /average/ computer
user still can't type more than maybe 5-10wpm, NL is a painfully slow
clunky interface.Put it this way: Would you login, wake the bot and ask for the Seattle
weather, or would you do as we /all/ do and just click the weather
icon sitting there on your desktop?Just for fun, here's an interesting conversation between Shallow Red,
ALICE and Eliza as they decide to play the Turing Game:http://www.botspot.com/best/12-09-97.htm--

thinly-veneered anti-colonial hooligans.  There is also Vietnamese Buddhism, unless you count setting fire to
oneself as a ""foul action"".    S> C) Many splinter Christianity religions have 'clean hands' but
    S> they also aren't 'found in the wild'.You'd have to explain ""found in the wild"".  For example, I know of
no violence perpetrated by the South Pacific ""Cargo Cults"" outside
of a pretty darn /mean/ game of cricket.    S> D) The Northern Ireland Protestant vs. Catholic feud, recently
    S> more or less concluded, is not completely unlike this kind of
    S> friction generated by splitting society too much along

noticed on networking aboriginal groups around the world is that the
British Army, with the US Army as a proxy by extension, were the
common thread.  Where neither was present (physically or through
influence) there /tended/ to be less violence.The issue in Ireland is complex, but rest assured that religious
aspects are only a co-incidence of the invader/colonials being
predominantly members of the Royal-headed Anglicans and the aboriginal
population being predominantly members of the Pope-headed Catholics.
The conflict itself has nothing to do with ideology or practice, since
the Anglican Church is a near-identical clone of Catholicism.(now I bet that's going to attract some healthy debate ;)    S> .. most Protestants are unionists who want the
    S> province to remain part of Britain.Mebst. Mebst.  It's the other way around.  Most Unionists are protestants.
It's their _Unionism_ that is the source of the conflict, not their
sacriments.    S> ... Police records and historians agree that the most lethal
    S> group by far was the IRA, fighting on the Catholic side with a
    S> goal of a united IrelandAnd which side of the colonial fence do you suppose the Police and
Historians sit?  If the Russians had invaded the USA as feared in
episodes such as the Bay of Pigs, would the Americans have organized
to become a ""lethal force"", or would they have just said, ""Oh well,
there goes /that/ democracy!"" and settle in under communist rule?Just wondering.    >> 2. The US is trying to avoid making war on the Muslim religion.It is interesting to me that the Canadian media is trying to paint
Chretien as some sort of buffoon for saying that 3rd-world poverty was
a major contributor to 9-11.  If they'd /watch/ his now-infamous
interview, they'd see that it's still us-against-hooligans, but his
point is that the hooligans would not be able to find friendly states
so easily if those states were not so bled-dry by the west.The same is true of street-gangs: When people are disenfranchised,
it's easier to offer them the Triad as a new family.  You get
cellphones, cars, a dry place to live.  Triad, biker gangs, mafia, the
IRA, Al Queda ... we've been fighting the War on Terrorism for as long
as there's been commerce, so you'd think we'd /realize/ that
escalation of violence is not a solution.--

High-Altitude Rambos
By BOB HERBERTDr. Bob Rajcoomar, a U.S. citizen and former military physician from Lake
Worth, Fla., found himself handcuffed and taken into custody last month in
one of the many episodes of hysteria to erupt on board airliners in the
U.S. since the Sept. 11 attacks.Dr. Rajcoomar was seated in first class on a Delta Airlines flight from
Atlanta to Philadelphia on Aug. 31 when a passenger in the coach section
began behaving erratically. The passenger, Steven Feuer, had nothing to do
with Dr. Rajcoomar.Two U.S. air marshals got up from their seats in first class and moved back
to coach to confront Mr. Feuer, who was described by witnesses as a slight
man who seemed disoriented. What ensued was terrifying. When Mr. Feuer
refused to remain in his seat, the marshals reacted as if they were trying
out for the lead roles in Hollywood's latest action extravaganza.They handcuffed Mr. Feuer, hustled him into first class and restrained him
in a seat next to Dr. Rajcoomar. The 180 or so passengers were now quite
jittery. Dr. Rajcoomar asked to have his seat changed and a flight
attendant obliged, finding him another seat in first class. The incident,
already scary, could - and should - have ended there. But the marshals were
not ready to let things quiet down.One of the marshals pulled a gun and brandished it at the passengers. The
marshals loudly demanded that all passengers remain in their seats, and
remain still. They barked a series of orders. No one should stand for any
reason. Arms and legs should not extend into the aisles. No one should try
to visit the restroom. The message could not have been clearer: anyone who
disobeyed the marshals was in danger of being shot.The passengers were petrified, with most believing that there were
terrorists on the plane.""I was afraid there was going to be a gun battle in that pressurized
cabin,"" said Senior Judge James A. Lineberger of the Philadelphia Court of
Common Pleas, a veteran of 20 years in the military, who was sitting in an
aisle seat in coach. ""I was afraid that I was going to die from the gunfire
in a shootout.""Dr. Rajcoomar's wife, Dorothy, who was seated quite a distance from her
husband, said, ""It was really like Rambo in the air."" She worried that
there might be people on the plane who did not speak English, and therefore
did not understand the marshals' orders. If someone got up to go to the
bathroom, he or she might be shot.There were no terrorists on board. There was no threat of any kind. When
the plane landed about half an hour later, Mr. Feuer was taken into
custody. And then, shockingly, so was Dr. Rajcoomar. The air marshals
grabbed the doctor from behind, handcuffed him and, for no good reason that
anyone has been able to give, hauled him to an airport police station where
he was thrown into a filthy cell.This was airline security gone berserk. No one ever suggested that Dr.
Rajcoomar, a straight-arrow retired Army major, had done anything wrong.Dr. Rajcoomar, who is of Indian descent, said he believes he was taken into
custody solely because of his brown skin. He was held for three frightening
hours and then released without being charged. Mr. Feuer was also released.Officials tried to conceal the names of the marshals, but they were
eventually identified by a Philadelphia Inquirer reporter as Shawn B.
McCullers and Samuel Mumma of the Transportation Security Administration,
which is part of the U.S. Transportation Department.The Transportation Security Administration has declined to discuss the
incident in detail. A spokesman offered the absurd explanation that Dr.
Rajcoomar was detained because he had watched the unfolding incident ""too
closely.""If that becomes a criterion for arrest in the U.S., a lot of us reporters
are headed for jail.Dr. Rajcoomar told me yesterday that he remains shaken by the episode. ""I
had never been treated like that in my life,"" he said. ""I was afraid that I
was about to be beaten up or killed.""Lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union have taken up his case and
he has filed notice that he may sue the federal government for unlawful
detention.""We have to take a look at what we're doing in the name of security,"" said
Dr. Rajcoomar. ""So many men and women have fought and died for freedom in
this great country, and now we are in danger of ruining that in the name of
security.""--

"organizational changes we are making a number of significant organizational changes . these changes are intended to accomplish four key objectives : first , we need to realign all our wholesale businesses around the successful business model developed over the last decade in north america and europe . this model relies on extensive physical and transactional networks built around a relatively small strategic asset position . second , we need to significantly streamline corporate reporting relationships . particularly with joe sutton  , s departure , the ability to directly manage the day - to - day activities of 15 independent business units has become increasingly difficult . third , we need to accomplish these changes without , in any way , compromising the ongoing profitability of all our businesses and without delaying or hindering our effort to monetize a significant portion of our lower - yielding asset positions . and fourth , as always , we need to take advantage of the reorganization to redeploy our talent into our highest value opportunities . enron wholesale services today , we are forming enron wholesale services ( ews ) which will consolidate our global wholesale businesses . the closer alignment of our wholesale businesses will accomplish the following : ( 1 ) enhanced communication and coordination across business units , ( 2 ) more rapid deployment of people to higher valued opportunities , ( 3 ) more effective prioritization of opportunities across the wholesale business , and ( 4 ) more rapid extension of enron  , s wholesale business model and capabilities into new industries and markets . enron wholesale services will include our current north american , european ( including japan and australia ) , global markets , and industrial markets operations , and will be expanded to include enron  , s net works business unit as well as a new unit  ) enron global assets . in addition , enron  , s merchant businesses outside of north america and europe will be integrated into this new structure as described below . mark frevert , currently chairman of each of our wholesale units , will assume the role of chairman and ceo of enron wholesale services . greg whalley , currently chairman and ceo of enron net works , will join mark in the office of the chairman as president and chief operating officer . providing further impetus for these organizational changes , several of our international business unit leaders have elected to move into new leadership positions : rebecca mcdonald , currently ceo of enron apachi , will join ews as president and ceo of enron global assets . enron global assets will have responsibility for managing all of enron  , s existing energy asset portfolio outside of north america and europe . joining rebecca in the office of the chairman as coo will be jim hughes , currently coo of enron apachi . rebecca and jim will report to the ews office of the chairman . sanjay bhatnagar , currently ceo of enron india , has joined ebs as ceo for the middle east and asia region . sanjay will be responsible for building our broadband business in this region and the current ebs team in this region will report to sanjay . in this role , sanjay will report to the ebs office of the chairman . in addition , sanjay will continue to remain responsible for enron  , s wholesale energy business in india and will transition this business into enron global assets in the near future . diomedes christodoulou , currently co - ceo of enron south america , has joined ebs as chief commercial officer . diomedes will be located in london and will focus his origination activities on global opportunities , with near term attention to the wholesale and enterprise sectors . diomedes will report to the ebs office of the chairman . jim bannantine , currently co - ceo of enron south america , will be joining ees to lead ees  , commercial efforts outside north america and europe . in order to ensure a smooth transition for our south american businesses and to facilitate our asset sales activities , jim will remain in south america for at least the next several months and continue to serve as ceo of enron south america . throughout the transition , jim will report to cliff baxter and to the office of the chairman of enron wholesale services . following the transition , jim will join ees . in addition to these changes in our international asset operations activities , we are making the following changes in our merchant wholesale businesses and the commercial support functions : enron net works louise kitchen will assume greg  , s previous responsibilities as president and ceo of enron net works , reporting into mark and greg . enron americas concurrent with the transfer to enron global assets of responsibility for operating enron  , s south and central america asset base , all trading , marketing , and new asset development activities in these regions will report into a new entity , enron americas . enron americas will have responsibility for all wholesale merchant businesses across north , central and south america . dave delainey , president and ceo , and john lavorato , chief operating officer will comprise the office of the chairman for enron americas . enron europe the enron europe organization , which includes enron  , s businesses in australia and japan , and enron metals , remains unchanged under the leadership of john sherriff , president and ceo , and michael brown , chief operating officer . enron global markets enron global markets , under the leadership of mike mcconnell , president and ceo , and jeff shankman , chief operating officer , will continue to have responsibility for enron  , s middle east and lng operations . with the exception of ecoelectrica in puerto rico , all operating power plants and associated personnel in the caribbean and central america will transfer to enron global assets . enron global markets will also continue to manage the commodity businesses in crude and products , coal , weather , insurance , equities , interest rates , foreign exchange , and agricultural products . enron industrial markets enron industrial markets  , organization , under the leadership of jeff mcmahon , president & ceo , and ray bowen , chief operating officer , remains unchanged . commercial support for ews the commercial support functions for ews will remain with , and be managed by , the individual business units . we are creating no incremental overhead in the creation of ews , and in fact hope to reduce our operating costs by more efficient utilization and sharing of resources across ews . to this end we have asked several people to take on an expanded role across ews in addition to their ongoing roles within their business units . these newly defined roles are as follows : mid and back office operations  ) sally beck will lead mid and back office operations across ews . these services will become part of enron net works , with sally reporting to louise kitchen and rick causey , executive vice president and chief accounting officer . this alignment creates a coordinated services organization with it and e -

Release Notes for libpng 
ftp://swrinde.nde.swri.edu/pub/png-group/archives/png-list.200207libpng is a library used to create and manipulate PNG (Portable
Network Graphics) image files.The 1.2.4* and 1.0.14 releases of libpng solve a potential buffer
overflow vulnerability[1] in some functions related to progressive
image loading. Programs such as mozilla and various others use these
functions. An attacker could exploit this to remotely run arbitrary
code or crash an application by using a specially crafted png image.These new releases also solve other minor bugs such as some memory
leaks in reading image functions.Since most applications which display images use libpng, this affects
many applications including Evolution and Mozilla. Additionally, Red
Carpet links libpng statically and needs to be updated separately.Ximian only ships libpng on Solaris, and so we only have Solaris
packages available. When distribution vendors update their packages,
they will be available in Red Carpet. Please use Red Carpet to upgrade
libpng to 1.0.14 and Red Carpet 1.3.4-2. You can also get packages
from the Ximian FTP site:Solaris 7/8

"" i promptly mailed four $ 5 bills and , after receiving the reports , paid a friend of mine a small fee to send out some e-mail advertisements for me . after reading the reports , i also learned how easy it is to bulk e-mail for free ! i was not prepared for the results . every day for the last six weeks , my p . o . box has been overflowing with $ 5 bills ; many days the excess fills up an extra mail bin and i ' ve had to upgrade to the corporate-size box ! i am stunned by all the money that keeps rolling in ! my husband and i have been saving for several years to make a substantial downpayment on a house . now , not only are we purchasing a house with 40 % down , we ' re going to venice , italy to celebrate ! i promise you , if you follow the directions in this e-mail and be prepared to eventually set aside about an hour each day to follow up ( and count your money ! ) , you will make at least as much money as we did . if you can open an envelope , remove the money , and send an e-mail message , then you ' re on your way to thebank . take the time to read this so you ' ll understand how easy it is . if i can do this , so can you ! _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ * * * print this now for future reference * * * the following income opportunity is one you may be interested in taking a look at . it can be started with very little investment and the income return is tremendous ! ! ! $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ you are about to make at least $ 50 , 000 in less than 90 days ! please read the enclosed program . . . then read it again ! ! ! $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ this is a legitimate , legal , money making opportunity . it does not require you to come into contact with people , do any hard work , and best of all , you never have to leave the house except to get the mail . if you believe that someday you ' ll get that big break that you ' ve been waiting for , this is it ! simply follow the instructions , and your dream will come true . this multi-level e-mail order marketing program works perfectly . . . 100 % every time . e - mail is the sales tool of the future . take advantage of this non-commercialized method of advertising now ! ! ! the longer you wait , the more people will be doing business using e-mail . get your piece of this action ! ! ! multi-level marketing ( mlm ) has finally gained respectability . it is being taught in the harvard business school , and both stanford research and the wall street journal have stated that between 50 % and 65 % of all goods and services will be sold through multi-level methods by the mid to late 1990 's . this is a multi - billion dollar industry and of the 500 , 000 millionaires in the u . s . , 20 % ( 100 , 000 ) made their fortune in the last several years in mlm . moreover , statistics show 45 people become millionaires everyday through multi - level marketing . the enclosed information is something i almost let slip through my fingers . fortunately , sometime later i re-read everything and gave some thought and study to it . my name is christopher erickson . two years ago , the corporation i worked at for the past twelve years down-sized and my position was eliminated . after unproductive job interviews , i decided to open my own business . over the past year , i incured many unforeseen financial problems . i owed my family , friends and creditors over $ 35 , 000 . the economy was taking a toll on my business and i just could n't seem to make ends meet . i had to refinance and borrow against my home to support my family and struggling business . at that moment something significant happend in my life and i am writing to share the experience in hopes that this will change your life forever financially ! ! ! in mid december , i received this program via e-mail . six month 's prior to receiving this program i had been sending away for information on various business opportunities . all of the programs i received , in my opinion , were not cost effective . they were either too difficult for me to comprehend or the initial investment was too much for me to risk to see if they would work or not . one claimed that i would make a million dollars in one year . . . it did n't tell me i 'd have to write a book to make it ! but like i was saying , in december of 1995 i received this program . i did n't send for it , or ask for it , they just got my name off a mailing list . thank goodness for that ! ! ! after reading it several times , to make sure i was reading it correctly , i could n't believe my eyes . here was a money making phenomenon . i could invest as much as i wanted to start , without putting me further into debt . after i got a pencil and paper and figured it out , i would at least get my money back . after determining the program was legal and not a chain letter , i decided "" why not . "" initially i sent out 10 , 000 e-mails . it cost me about $ 15 . 00 for my time on-line . the great thing about e-mail is that i do n't need any money for printing to send out the program , only the cost to fulfill my orders . i am telling you like it is , i hope it does n't turn you off , but i promised myself that i would not "" rip-off "" anyone , no matter how much money it cost me ! in less than one week , i was starting to receive orders for report # 1 . by january 13 , i had received 26 orders for report # 1 . when you read the guarantee in the program , you will see that "" you must receive 15-20 orders for report # 1 within 2 weeks . if you don ' t , send out more programs until you do ! "" my first step in making $ 50 , 000 in 20-90 days was done . by january 30 , i had received 196 orders for report # 2 . if you go back to the guarantee , "" you must receive 100 + orders for report # 2 within 2 weeks . if not , send out more programs until you do . once you have 100 orders , the rest is easy , relax , you will make your $ 50 , 000 goal "" well , i had 196 orders for report # 2 , 96 more than i needed . so i sat back and relaxed . by march 19 , of my e-mailing of 10 , 000 , i received $ 58 , 000 with more coming in every day . i paid off all my debts and bought a much needed new car . please take time to read the attatched program , it will change your life forever ! ! ! remember , it won't work if you do n't try it . this program does work , but you must follow it exactly ! especially the rules of not trying to place your name in a different place . it won't work , you ' ll lose out on a lot of money ! report # 2 explains this . always follow the guarantee , 15-20 orders for report # 1 , and 100 + orders for report # 2 and you will make $ 50 , 000 or more in 20-90 days . i am living proof that it works ! ! ! if you choose not to participate in this program , i am sorry . it really is a great opportunity with little cost or risk to you . if you choose to participate , follow the program and you will be on your way to financial security . if you are a fellow business owner and are if financial trouble like i was , or you want to start your own business , consider this a sign . i did ! sincerely , christopher erickson p . s . do you have any idea what 11 , 700 $ 5 bills ( $ 58 , 000 ) look like piled up on a kitchen table ? it ' s awesome ! a personal note from the orginator of this program : by the time you have read the enclosed program and reports , you should have concluded that such a program , and one that is legal , could not have been created by an amateur . let me tell you a little about myself . i had a profitable business for 10 years . then in 1979 my business began falling off . i was doing the same things that were previously successfull for me , but it was n't working . finally , i figured it out . it was n't me , it was the economy . inflation and recession had replaced the stable economy that had been with us since 1945 . i do n't have to tell you what happend to the unemployment rate . . . because many of you know from first hand experience . there were more failures and bankruptcies than ever before . the middle class was vanishing . those who knew what they were doing invested wisely and moved up . those who did not , including those who never had anything to save or invest , were moving down into the ranks of the poor . as the saying goes , "" the rich get richer and the poor get poorer . "" the traditional methods of making money will never allow you to "" move up "" or "" get rich "" , inflation will see to that . you have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life , with "" no risk "" and "" just a little bit of effort . "" you can make more money in the next few months than you have ever imagined . i should also point out that i will not see a penny of this money , nor anyone else who has provided a testimonial for this program . i have already made over 4 million dollars ! i have retired from the program after sending out over 16 , 000 programs . now i have several offices that make this and several other programs here and over seas . by the spring we wish to market the "" internet "" by a partnership with america on line . follow the program exactly as instructed . do not change it in any way . it works exceedingly well as it is now . remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report to everyone you can think of . one of the people you send this to may send out 50 , 000 . . . and your name will be on everyone of them ! remember though , the more you send out the more potential customers you will reach . so my friend , i have given you the ideas , information , materials and opportunity to become financially independent , it is up to you now ! "" think about it "" before you delete this program from your mailbox , as i almost did , take a little time to read it and really think about it . get a pencil and figure out what could happen when you participate . figure out the worst possible response and no matter how you calculate it , you will still make a lot of money ! you will definitely get back what you invested . any doubts you have will vanish when your first orders come in . it works ! paul johnson , raleigh , nc here ' s how this amazing program will make you $ $ $ $ $ let 's say that you decide to start small , just to see how it goes , and we ' ll assume you and all those involved send out only 2 , 000 programs each . let 's also assume that the mailing receives a 0 . 5 % response . using a good list the response could be much better . also many people will send out hundreds of thousands of programs instead of 2 , 000 . but continuing with this example , you send out only 2 , 000 programs . with a 0 . 5 % response , that is only 10 orders for report # 1 . those 10 people respond by sending out 2 , 000 programs each for a total of 20 , 000 . out of those 0 . 5 % , 100 people respond and order report # 2 . those 100 mail out 2 , 000 programs each for a total of 200 , 000 . the 0 . 5 % response to that is 1 , 000 orders for report # 3 . those 1 , 000 send out 2 , 000 programs each for a 2 , 000 , 000 total . the 0 . 5 % response to that is 10 , 000 orders for report # 4 . that 's 10 , 000 $ 5 bills for you . cash ! ! ! your total income in this example is $ 50 + $ 500 + $ 5 , 000 + $ 50 , 000 for a total of $ 55 , 550 ! ! ! remember friend , this is assuming 1 , 990 out of the 2 , 000 people you mail to will do absolutely nothing and trash this program ! dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone , or half sent out 100 , 000 programs instead of 2 , 000 . believe me , many people will do just that , and more ! by the way , your cost to participate in this is practically nothing . you obviously already have an internet connection and e-mail is free ! ! ! report # 3 will show you the best methods for bulk e-mailing and obtaining e-mail lists . instructions : we at erris mail order marketing businesses , have a method of raising capital that really works 100 % everytime . i am sure that you could use $ 50 , 000 to $ 125 , 000 in the next 20-90 days . before you say "" bull . . . "" , please read this program carefully . this is not a chain letter , but a perfectly legal money making opportunity . basically , this is what you do : as with all multi-level business , we build our business by recruiting new partners and selling our products . every state in the usa allows you to recruit new multi-level business partners , and we offer a product for every dollar sent . your orders come and are filled through the mail , so you are not involved in personal selling . you do it privately in your own home , store or office . this is the greatest multi - level mail order marketing anywhere : step ( 1 ) order all four ( 4 ) reports listed by name and number . do this by ordering the report from each of the four ( 4 ) names listed on the next page . for each report , send $ 5 cash and a self-addressed stamped envelope ( business size # 10 ) to the person listed for the specific report . international orders should also include $ 1 extra for postage . it is essential that you specify the name and number of the report requested to the person you are ordering it from . you will need all four ( 4 ) reports because you will be reprinting and reselling them . do not alter the names or sequence other than what the instructions say . important : always provide same-day service on all orders . step ( 2 ) replace the name and address under report # 1 with your 's , moving the one that was there down to report # 2 . drop the name and address under report # 2 to report # 3 , moving the one that was there to report # 4 . the name and the address that was under report # 4 is dropped from the list and this party is no doubt on the way to the bank . when doing this , make certain you type the names and addresses accurately ! ! ! do not mix up moving product / report positions ! ! ! step ( 3 ) having made the requested changes in the name list , save it as text ( . txt ) file in it 's own directory to be used with whatever e-mail program you like . again , report # 3 will tell you the best methods of bulk e-mailing and acquiring e-mail lists . step ( 4 ) e - mail a copy of the entire program ( all of this is very important ) to everyone whose address you can get your hands on . start with friends and relatives since you can encourage them to take advantage of this fabulous money-making opportunity . that 's what i did . and they love me now , more than ever . then , e-mail to anyone and everyone ! use your imagination ! you can get e-mail addresses from companies on the internet who specialize in e-mail mailing lists . these are very cheap , 100 , 000 addresses for around $ 35 . important : you won't get a good response if you use an old list , so always request a fresh , new list . you will find out where to purchase these lists when you order the four ( 4 ) reports . always provide same-day service on all orders ! ! ! required reports : * * * order each report by number and name * * * always send a self-addressed , stamped envelope and $ 5 cash for each order requesting the specific report by name and number . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ report # 1 "" how to make $ 250 , 000 through multi-level sales "" order report # 1 from : angel ann enterprises p . o . box 668292 charlotte , n . c . 28266-8292 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ report # 2 "" major corporations and multi-level sales "" order report # 2 from : m . l . m . 3069 alamo dr . suite 178 vacaville , ca . 95687-6344 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ report # 3 "" sources for the best mailing lists "" order report # 3 from : c . e . e . p . o . box 5145 framingham , ma 01701-5145 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ report # 4 "" evaluating multi-level sales plans "" order report # 4 from : m . j . k . p . o . box 30821 seattle , wa 98103-0821 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ conclusion : i am enjoying my fortune that i made by sending out this program . you too , will be making money in 20-90 days , if you follow the simple steps outlined in this mailing . to be financially independent is to be free . free to make financial decisions as never before . go into business , get into investments , retire or take a vacation . no longer will a lack of money hold you back . however , very few people reach financial independence , because when opportunity knocks , they choose to ignore it . it is much easier to say "" no "" than "" yes "" , and this the question that you must answer . will you ignore this amazing opportunity or will you take advantage of it ? if you do nothing , you have indeed missed something and nothing will change . please re-read this material , this is a special opportunity . if you have any questions , please feel free to write to the sender of this information . you will get a prompt and informative reply . my method is simple . i sell thousands of people a product for $ 5 that cost me pennies to produce and e-mail . i should also point out that this program is legal and everyone who participates will make money . this is not a chain letter or a pyramid scam . at times you probably received chain letters , asking you to send money , on faith , but getting nothing in return , no product what-so - ever ! not only are chain lettters illegal , but the risk of someone breaking the chain makes them quite unattractive . you are offering a legitimate product to your people . after they purchase the product from you , they reproduce more and resell them . it 's simple free enterprise . as you learned from the enclosed material , the product is a series of four ( 4 ) financial and business reports . the information contained in these reports will not only help you in making your participation in this program more rewarding , but will be useful to you in any other business decisions you make in the years ahead . you are also buying the rights to reprint all of the reports , which will be ordered from you by those to whom you mail this program . the concise one and two page reports you will be buying can easily be reproduced at a local copy center for a cost of about 3 cents a copy . best wishes with the program and good luck ! _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _",Phishing Email

which hasn't yet been released (again). Bad enough the first time, and
I'm sure it gave RedHat a lot of embarrassment.FWIW, I've yet to compile apt on the gcc 3.2 snapshot in RawHide - apt's
C++ makes several rather poor assumptions on what iterators are, and in
addition doesn't use namespaces at all.For non-C++ folk, this basically means it needs porting. I've got a
reasonable way along, now, and I'll send a suitable patch to Connectiva
or somewhere when I succeed - I can't find anything on Connectiva's site
itself for this.In addition, the rpmlib stuff has changed slightly - I've not really
started on this, but it's mainly just arguments added. The rpmlib
documentation seems somewhat poor, though, unless I've missed it.Dave.

"Surely it would be faster to save you conf files, install it on the box
again, copy back you confs and voila.
All you car about are the confs as the boite has no DATA right?Thats what I would do, but you sysadmins have to make life as difficult &
complicated as possible ;--)Have you thought about mirroring the system drives? Might save you serious
hassle down the line. Only kidding but thats what I would do.CW----------------
OK, Here's how to do it [1] ...While the disk is still installed in the i686 machine (if that's broken,
beg, borrow or steal...), remove the i686 versions of glibc and kernel and
install the i386 versions.  This will break one or two other packages since
they have entries in /etc/ld.so.conf which belongs to glibc.  these packages
will need to be reinstalled.  So:1. rpm -e --nodeps glibc	Your /etc/ld.so.conf has been saved as /etc/ld.so.conf.rpmsave2. rpm -ivh glibc--i386.rpm
3. rpm -e --nodeps kernel
4. rpm -ivh kernel--i386.rpmThis installs the i386 versions of kernel and glibc.  You'll be able to boot
in a non 686 machine now.  However, X is now broken as is kerberos.  At
least those are the two I noticed.  Your /etc/ld.so.conf.rpmsave will
contain clues as to what else might be broken.  To fix X and kerberos you
need to reinstall their libs (copying /etc/ld.so.conf.rpmsave back to
/etc/ld.so.conf doesn't seem to work):1. rpm -ivh --replacepkgs XFree86-libs--i386.rpm
2. rpm -ivh --replacepkgs krb5-libs--i386.rpmfixes them.  Other libs listed in _my_ /etc/ld.so.conf are qt, mysql and
sane.  If they start behaving in odd fashions, it may be related.
Reinstalling the libs for these packages may fix that.Thanks guys...> [snip]

K6-x box.  Essentially, the P3/4/celeron processor is an i686 class while
the AMD K6 processor is an i586 class (not sure about the AMD athlon or
duron chips).  A RHL installed on the i686 class machine will not boot on an
i586 calss box since both kernel and glibc are optimised for i686.  The
solution is to replace the i686 kernel and glibc with i386 versions.

"http://www.techcentralstation.com/1051/printer.jsp?CID=1051-080802A>Mail Me the Money!
>By David Friedman 08/08/2002David is a very bright fellow. But this time he's
several years behind. The idea of using epostage
to stop spam has been discussed quite a bit. The
problem is how to get over the adoption hump.
Until most people are taking one form of epostage,
most people don't have enough incentive to download
and install something that allows them to pay it.
Until most people are set up to pay it, any form of
epostage I require closes my mailbox to unknown
senders from whom I want to receive mail. And even
from known senders. Giving someone my email address
doesn't automatically put them in my white list.Hashcash tries to lower the adoption barrier by
removing the need to pay money for epostage.
Instead, the sender burns processing time on his
computer, answering a cryptographically hard
challenge. But even this requires set-up. There is
inadequate incentive to do so until there is a
standard mechanism, but no standard mechanism is
born until a significant fraction of the market
has taken that first step. It may take government
action, to institute an effective epostage
standard!I think the better idea is to require that people
off your white list ""hand sign"" email to you. A
couple of companies are now trying to implement
this. An email sender, if not on your white list,
must respond to a verification email or go to a
website, by a process that is very simply for a
human sender, but difficult for a spammer to
automate. Where epostage requires a standard
mechanism, a variety of mechanisms for ""hand
signing"" would frustrate spammers while making it
no more difficult for legitimate senders. I'm
hoping Eudora and some of the other big mail
clients incorporate this kind of feature. The
advantage to putting this in the mail client is
that the required ""hand sign"" can be personalized:  ""Your attempt to email David Friedman is
  blocked until you fill in the blank: The
  Incredible ______ Machine.""It will be a long time before spammers have a
process that defeats millions of personal
challenges. On the other hand, I have a hack in
mind that would work a large percentage of the
time. But I'm not telling. If spammers did figure
out such hacks, people would then improve their
challenges. Yeah, this would lead to another
arms race, and spam would leak through to the
unwitting. But this arms race is one that helps
spammers identify and target the part of the
population whose challenges are sub-par, which
is their natural prey. People like David aren't
in the market for herbal Viagra or back alley
debt consolidation.Since David is an anarchist, I'm surprised he
didn't point out that spam is the result of
government. The government is ineffective at
preventing spam, but it DOES prevent individuals
and ISPs from taking retribution against spammers.

collins : well , any time that a company goes through a short term period of troubles , the industry surrounding that , that has an intricate layer of credit relationships , is concerned about their ability to be paid . haffenreffer : but for people who don ` t know what enron does , what role do they play in the trading of natural gas futures ? collins : well , they are a major counter - party in the natural gas industry in trading , selling and distributing natural gas . and so , they have an extensive network of credit relationship with virtually every natural gas company in the north american industry . haffenreffer : are they involved , in some way , with almost every trade having to do with natural gas ? are they that big ? collins : no . i wouldn ` t say that they ` re involved with every trade . they ` re involved in a substantial amount of trading through their electronic market making system . but , no , they ` re only a component of the market , and only do , perhaps , a percentage of what trades on the nymex . haffenreffer : so when trading takes place , and it ` s very fast , there ` s a lot of money changing hands all the time . there ` s a lot of credit given to people trading and when a company like enron has got some liquidity problems , or just even fears of liquidity problems , that can affect people who do trades with them . collins : yes . absolutely . it can cause people to retract from trading . it can cause disruptions in the natural flow of trading . it ` s not unlike the financial markets at all . when you have a serious credit concern . haffenreffer : as result , the nymex is working at a faster clip to get a clearing service set up . is that right ?

"" we have to wait for the reaction of the four companies to see if they will change their accounting system so that they do not hinder other competitiors , "" cartel office spokesman stefan siebert told reuters . "" if they don ' t do that , then ultimately we could issue an injunction to force them to do so . "" the competition authority said earlier in a statement it had received complaints that grid operators bewag ( bklg . de , enbw , hew and veag that the four firms "" charge their competitors unreasonable and partly fictitious costs "" for balancing energy . german grid operators have sole control over the purchase and sale of such power in their grid areas , which they control by temporarily switching on and off their power plants . this poses a potential threat to other power suppliers . "" new entrants to the german market , such as london ' s enron capital & resources and hamburg ' s lichtblick , because of their small customer portfolios , cannot balance unplanned amounts of power withdrawn as well as the big utilitiy groups can , "" the statement said . "" consequently they have a greater need for balancing energy ( and ) are threatened with the considerable burden of unreasonable prices for it . "" the four utilities have argued that the accounting system they use for balancing energy corresponds to guidelines in the country ' s association agreement ( vv 2 ) , which is due to be modified by next year .

"GAMING ADVISOR  NEWS July 16, 2002   i2corp Enters into Research and Development Agreement with Nevada Gaming Equipment Supplier For Live Remote Bingo.      
 
The general feeling of the Top Internet Lawyers and Analysts is that ""online gambling and sports betting is here to stay.Â” Attempts at trying to stop it would be largely ineffective! Banning Internet gambling and sports betting presents technical and legal problems that Governments are ill equipped to enforce. WhatÂ’s more, there are NO competitors for the CompanyÂ’s method or technology for remote wagering. i2corp is the Only Company in the World that can legally license its method and technology for remote wagering. i2corp is currently negotiating with
Major Casinos Globally.    
 
Michael Pollock of the Pollock Gaming Resource Group (PRRG) has issued a report studying the effects of live wagering from remote locations. Â“ The study concludes that live wagering from remote locations does more than create a new source of revenue for sponsoring casinos. Additionally, it creates a marketing opportunity, a means to find and cultivate thousands of new customers who can be encouraged to become on-site patrons.Â” A copy of the full report in pdf format can be downloaded at http://www.gamingobserver.com/.
 
i2corp is the holding company for Home Gambling Network, Inc. HGN holds U.S. Patent 5,800,268, which covers remote wagering on live games and events with electronic financial transactions. The Patent is comprised of three primary actions: the gambling is live; the player is remote and physically away from the actual game or event; and the winnings and losses are transacted electronically in real time. They include, but are not limited to, horse racing, soccer, bingo, poker, roulette and many other Las Vegas Casino Games. FACT: Currently there is an overwhelming opinion that remote wagering in real-time will become one of the most profitable/prolific industries worldwide. i2corp recently won judgment against giant UUNET a subsidiary of MCI/WorldCom in a U.S. Federal Court for Patent infringement. Just another compelling reason why i2corp has orphaned their competition! Therefore we conclude i2corpÂ’s common stock to be overlooked and undervalued! RECOMMENDATION: STRONG BUY     i2corp

"flow change for fuels cotton valley redeliveries into hpl saturday , march 3 , the redeliveries into hpl from fuels cotton valley for the eastrans deal will increase to approximately 19500 mmbtu / dy . this change should continue through march 5 th or 6 th . the reason for the change is an operational emergency . defs typically delivers approximately 12200 mmbtu / dy into txu lone star . this delivery will not be able to occur because the alford b compressor needs to get into the shop for maintenance . this compressor will be out of commission for the month of march . the busby compressor will compress the usual 7300 mmbtu / dy of fuels cotton valley redelivery gas as well as the 12200 mmbtu / dy of txu lone star redelivery gas . a different redelivery point with txu lone star is being established and should be available by march 5 th or 6 th . at this point in time , we will take the hpl fuels cotton valley redelivery gas to zero and balance the redeliveries between the two points . therefore , defs will not change the delivery or redelivery nominations in place for eastrans . after the new txu lone star redelivery point is put into place and the points are volume balanced , it is our intent to have redeliveries of 7300 mmbtu / dy from fuels cotton valley and 22700 mmbtu / dy into pg & e ( which is what is in place effective 3 / 1 / 01 ) for eastrans .",Safe Email

"Snoring problems? Let Snore
Eliminator's all natural ingredients help you
sleep!Â Â Â Â Â Â  1r
Is snoring
keeping you up all night? No
more sleepless nights with
Snore Eliminator!!
Let your family sleep again by using the Snore Eliminator!
Do you know someone with a snoring problem? Snore Eliminator will help them
and they will love you for it.
Improve your sexual performance by reducing snoring and thus increasing
oxygen to your body!!People who snore have a higher risk of developing heart attacks, high blood
pressure, or strokes!! Snoring
also causes sleep disturbances that lead to increased anxiety,
hyperirritability, and decreased memory!
Individuals who snore have a 90% chance of daytime fatigue. Nine out of every
ten victims are male!How the Snore Eliminator will help you!What Causes Snoring?Over-relaxed throat and tongue muscles due to poor throat muscle
Excessive fat on the throat
Accumulation of secretion in the back of the throat and
Throat swelling from allergies and food
Heavy snoring is often associated with apnea, or the stopping
of breathing, during sleep. As
an individuals sleeps his or her sleeping pattern is disrupted and fragmented
due to snoring, thus they are never well rested. This can be a very hazardous
problem if someone is not getting proper REM sleep. Snoring is the audible
symptom of a blocked airway during sleep.The noise is caused by a vibration in the soft palate as the lungs pull hard
to take in a weakened current of incoming air. This blockage may result
from any number of circumstances, and these offer clues to get rid of the
problem.
Snoring is also more than likely to occur among people who sleep on their
backs; the tongue falls back toward the throat and partly closes the airway.The hidden dangers of snoring?
Snoring could increase the chances of a heart attack if not treated
Hypertension and increased anxiety are associated with snoring
Snoring causes sleep apnea a serious treatable medical conditionSnoring decreases sexual performance
by half, due to lack of oxygen
to the brain which decreases sexual responsiveness.
Most people who snore have a shortage
of oxygen for a
significant portion of that person's life. In recent studies, daytime fatigue
and cardiovascular disorder are related to snoring. In a few cases, heavy
snoring is a sign of potentially life -threatening problem. Sleep apnea in which
breathing stops for a second or even minutes at a time and finally resumes with
snorting and tossing around. This pattern may be repeated hundreds of times all
night long. The result is chronic oxygen shortage, which leads to abnormal heart
rhythms, high blood pressure, and heart strain.How the Snore Eliminator works!Snore Eliminator offers a unique break through with its all natural
enzymes which metabolize the
secretions, allowing the body to absorb them into the back of the throat. The
herbs reduce tissue swelling. The result is to open the airway and smooth the
airflow. This in turn eliminates the snoring for hours at a time. It also
reduces the noise made by
breathing through the mouth while sleeping.
By simply spraying the back of the throat, tongue and uvula with our special
formula, manufactured using our patented break through process, the soft tissue
is coated. This allows the throat
a chance to relax thus a
reduced amount of snoring. In most cases snoring is eliminated. Snore Eliminator
coats the throat area with a unique patented process of all natural lubricants.TESTIMONIALS from several of our satisfied customers:Lorenzo writes...
I am having a good nights sleep, finally. I used to wake myself up during the
night which was a real bummer as I would not always go back to sleep. Sleeping
through the night is great. Thanks a lot Snore Eliminator.
PS: My girlfriend loves it as much or more than I do.
Alex writes...
My husband uses it for another reason. He has a problem with blocked nasal
passages. While he's asleep the passages close, he stops breathing and he wakes
up gasping. When he takes Snore Eliminator his nose stays clearer and he's able
to sleep more restfully.
Thank you for a product that has really helped us!
Glen writes...
In February 1995, I was diagnosed with severe sleep apnea. A CPAP was the
suggested treatment for my affliction, but it did not help my condition. I heard
your advertisement and ordered a bottle of Snore Eliminator and my sleep
improved immediately. I continue to use it and my sleep has been better than it
had been in years. Thanks.

I just want to be sure, that forwarding an email to my own spamtrap address
which performs a razor-report on the entire received email is not waste of
time, because the contents of the forwarded email is not recognized as equal
to the email originally received. The forwarded email has a new set of
headerlines, which should be discarded and instead the headerlines of the
original message are in the body of this new message and should be recognized
as such and treated properly.An ordinary Forward Unquoted in Agent is subject to character set conversions
and does not depict the received spam in its original form.I hope this clarifies my concerns.- JÃ¸rgen-------------------------------------------------------

I like this idea, but from my reading - part of my dissertation research -
on GAs (or, in this case, more precisely ""Evolutionary Programming"", since
the parameters are non-binary and the major operator is mutation, not
crossover), you do need to keep in mind that the more interactions there are
between different variables, the better-tweaked the GA/EA will need to be,
especially to avoid local optima (which may have been the problem with the
suspiciously-high ""anti-ratware"" USER_AGENT scores). From past results,
what's needed are one or more of the below:
        A. Determine mutational parameters by adapted-scores themselves,
           with variation on a per-original score basis; ideally, allow
           for having ""correlated"" mutations - in other words, have a
           mechanism in place for trying out changes to a bunch of scores at
           once, with them all moving about the same amount (albeit possibly
           in different directions) - one means to do this is found in the
           ""Evolutionary Strategies"" of Schwefel;
        B. Adapt the probability of a mutation taking place depending on how
           well previous mutation tries have done - if more than about a
           fifth of the new ""individuals"" are doing about as well as, or
           better than, the parental generation, then mutate more
           parameters; if less than a fifth of them are doing about as well
           as, or better than, the parental generation, then mutate less
           parameters.        -Allen------- You are receiving this mail because: -------

Technology shares climbed Monday as Pres. Bush gave a speech outlining a plan for long-term growth.Tech investors also heard positive comments on Intel by C.S. First Boston, and snapped up shares in the chip, storage and computer server hardware sectors. CNET's Tech index rose 15.22 points, or 1.53 percent, to 1,005.33, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index gained 9.04 points, or 0.65 percent, to 1,382.54.Amid news of a weakening dollar and an unexpected rise in business inventories in May, broader markets sank. Recovering some from early-day losses, the Dow Jones industrials finished by giving up 45.4 points, or 0.52 percent, to 8,639.1, and the S&P 500 slid 3.47 points, or 0.38 percent, to 917.92.
Will IBM's new ""Shark"" sink or swim? 
IBM announced a new top-end ""Shark"" storage system Monday that could boost the company's prospects against entrenched competitors in the depressed storage market.
Three years ago, IBM introduced its first Enterprise Storage System product, code-named Shark, in an attempt to rebuild a market it had almost totally ceded to rivals EMC and Hitachi Data Systems.INTL BUSINESS MACHINES 71.00 2.59% New products help absorb AMD pain 
Advanced Micro Devices turned out two new chips Monday, but its most anticipated release this week will be its second quarter results.
As expected, AMD launched on Monday a new mobile Athlon XP 1800+ chip for notebooks. The company also announced Monday it has begun shipping MirrorBit, its newest flash memory product for storing data in cell phones and other devices.ADVANCED MICRO DEV 9.25 1.65% Microsoft tries to steal Macworld thunder 
Microsoft on Monday launched the first of several pre-emptive strikes against Apple Computer's Macworld trade show by making announcements about new technologies far ahead of their delivery to market.
The strategic attack comes as tensions mount between Apple and Microsoft. During Macworld five years ago, the two companies announced a five-year technology agreement, whereby Microsoft committed to continued development of Office and Internet Explorer for the Mac.MICROSOFT CORP 51.80 -0.12%

C.S. First Boston expects an upbeat outlook from Intel in tech notes 7/15/02 
Analyst Tim Mahon predicts the chip titan will report second-quarter results in-line with expectations, but offer better-than-expected guidance for the third quarter. Intel rival AMD's poor quarterly results stemmed more from company-specific issues than PC market troubles, Mahon says. And he points to other evidence of PC strength, such as Dell's positive comments about the current quarter. Mahon also expects Intel to speak confidently about its new 845G chipset, which he suggests could pressure the shares of graphics chip firms. Mahon reiterates a ""buy"" rating on Intel.INTEL CORP 19.12 6.28%

"california update 6 / 5 / 01 executive summary ? edison ' s mou condemned at this friday ' s cpuc meeting ? the idle plan z ? angelides hides state budget concerns ? house committee to vote on energy relief edison ' s mou doubtful the unusually calm settling over the california legislature about socal edison ' s potential bankruptcy has finally affected the relentlessly optimistic investment bank analysts and other company shareholders . we have reported that through all plans from b - z , there is not a solid plan to save this company and now executives are even more fearful that this predictions may come to fruition . over the last few days , edison executives have begun pointing hard at the cpuc meeting this friday as a make - or - break event for the company . the is because after the meeting , davis ' s mou plan to buy socal ' s grid will have no chance of preventing a potential bankruptcy . this plan is essentially dead although governor daivs has yet to say this in a press releases . the final nail will happen after the cpuc adjourns its friday meeting without voting on several necessary mou provisions . unless the cpuc makes a last minute , emergency - amendment to their agenda , the deal will be dead ( despite socal ' s support for letting the deal stand past its deadline ) . sources indicate that cpuc president loretta lynch holds reservations on the mou and continues to distance herself from davis . attempting to influence policy making , edison executives have spent the last few investor phone conferences warning that june 8 would see substantially increased risks for a creditor - induced bankruptcy if the davis plan dies at cpuc . this is interesting , since no one else seems to have been focused on the date until edison began mentioning it late last week . however , there is no more or less threat of bankruptcy than there is now or will be in two weeks . as reported several times earlier , most everyone had given up on the mou long before this friday ' s cpuc meeting . plan z shows little progress meanwhile , the unhurried pace toward a plan z that we reported last friday , has gained little progress . legislators continue to pin - point a plan that will secure re - election votes and at the same time , weigh the need for rate hikes for california ' s corporate and home electricity users . as they hash it out , the state is spending even more on electricity purchases . in spite of better than expected levels of conservation , the state ' s electricity expenditures over the last month rose to an average of $ 79 m / day . the recent rate increases mean more spending by the state and that calls into question the reassuring angelides scenario for california ' s budget prospects later this year . the california budget crunch even more worrisome than a idle plan z is increasing evidence that last month ' s conference call with state treasurer angelides was a little misleading . during that conference call angelides claimed that state comptroller connell and many in the financial committee had the numbers wrong . angelides argued that $ 7 . 2 b already spent to buy power since january was really the total amount of authorized spending through late august . in fact , he said only $ 4 . 3 b of that had been "" spent . "" sources now indicate that angelides was technically correct if you use "" spent "" to mean only the amount of money for which checks had been written . this is different than the amount of money california had already promised to energy suppliers who had already supplied energy to the state . in fact , when angelides was speaking the state had in fact already promised to pay $ 7 b for energy it had already consumed ( the total committed has topped $ 8 b . ) by the time the state gets its "" power bonds "" auctioned in august , they will have already spent all $ 12 b and be back to dipping into the general fund . the idea of rans being auctioned before the power bonds get issued is still an option if the general fund doesn ' t make it to august . the nearest answer to both of these cash flow deficits lies in part in the painful process that the legislature is undertaking now - another round of huge electricity rate hikes to securitize debt issuance . then the hope is that those hikes bridge the gap between now and when new capacity brings wholesale rates down and the debts can be repaid . the only near term path to bringing generating assets on line immediately is the 3 , 500 mw from qf plants which are off line because of cash flow problems . settling their needs is wrapped up in settling the pg & e and edison trade creditor issues , which makes the legislature ' s leisurely approach to the rate hike / haircut situation all the more troublesome . energy relief the house energy & commerce committee is scheduled to vote on h . r . 1647 ( the emergency electricity relief act ) tomorrow at 10 : 00 am . the bill which was twice postponed and does not include any provisions on price caps , but during the course of the mark - up , sources indicate that it is possible , even likely , that a democrat could offer a price cap amendment . rep . waxman ( d - ca ) offered a price cap amendment at an earlier mark - up of the bill at the subcommittee level . the waxman amendment was rejected along party lines ( all republicans and 2 democrats voted nay ) . sources inside joe barton ' s office report that staff and members have been meeting to work out a compromise on the price cap issue , but nothing has been resolved . as of this afternoon , those discussions have been terminated in favor of an open discourse in the committee tomorrow . since an agreement was not reached , compromise language is not expected to be offered as an amendment tomorrow . if it is , it would not be something that leaders on the republican and democrat sides have crafted together and therefore would not likely pass . sources indicate that the committee does expect waxman , and possibly others to offer price cap language , but it is not expected to pass .",Safe Email
"Hi,	I'm no longer able to play encrypted dvd's using the xine rpm from freshrpms. 
I think it was about a week ago when I last rented some dvd's, worked just

"the Habeas Infringers List (HIL) exists explicitly to deal with spammers while we're getting judgments against them and especially in other countries, where those judgments are harder to get.Please note that nobody has ever had an incentive before to go after regular spammers. Yes, some attorneys general have prosecuted blatant pyramid schemes, and ISPs have won some theft of service suits, but the vast majority of spammers go forward with out any legal hassles. So, I can't understand how Daniel can assert that you can't track spammers down when it's never really been tried. We can subpoena the records of the business they spammed on behalf of. We can subpoena the records of the ISP that provided them service, and of the credit card they used for the whack-a-mole accounts. We can use private investigators. Yes, these people are often lowlifes (chickenboners). But, they're not secret agents. They're just trying to make a buck, and Habeas' whole business is about finding them and putting them out of businessHabeas has the incentive to pursue spammers (that use our warrant mark) in a way that no one ever has had before. Given that our whole business plan relies on Habeas becoming synonymous with ""not spam"", I can't understand why you would assume ahead of time that we will be unsuccessful, plan for that failure, and in so doing, remove the potential of success, which is anti-spam filters like SA acting on the Habeas warrant mark.Daniel, it's easy enough for you to change the Habeas scores yourself on your installation. If Habeas fails to live up to its promise to only license the warrant mark to non-spammers and to place all violators on the HIL, then I have no doubt that Justin and Craig will quickly remove us from the next release. But, you're trying to kill Habeas before it has a chance to show any promise.At the end of the day, SpamAssassin is like the Club, in that it encourages thieves (spammers) to just go after the next car (those without SA) rather than yours. Habeas can play the role of LoJack (the transmitter), in enabling the apprehension of thieves so that they don't steal any more cars. But only if we're given a chance to succeed. - dan -- Dan Kohn -----Original Message----- From: Daniel Quinlan [mailto:quinlan@pathname.com] Sent: Wednesday, August 28, 2002 16:38 To: Matthew Cline Cc: spamassassin-talk@example.sourceforge.net Subject: Re: [SAtalk] O.T. Habeus -- Why? Matthew Cline writes:> There must be *some* way of tracking a spammer down, since they are > planning on making money from the spam. What a court would consider > evidence of being the spammer is another question.Haha!!!Just a few notes: - It will be difficult to find, prosecute, and win money from someone in various non-friendly countries where spam originates (China is a good example) even if they do officially ""respect"" copyright law. - Law suits take time. Between now and conclusion of the first court case, we could have years of spam in our mail boxes! - Contact information can change: phone numbers, PO boxes, stolen cell phones, temporary email addresses, etc. - Spammers do not always remember to include contact information! I don't understand it either, but nobody said they were bright. Also, some spam is non-commercial or sent by a third-party (for example, ""pump and dump"" stock scams), so contact information is not strictly required for the spammer to get their way.Dan ------------------------------------------------------- This sf.net email is sponsored by: Jabber - The world's fastest growing real-time communications platform!

Another problem I have is that I cannot install my ISDN, USB modem ( LASAT Speed Basic ), however im pretty sure its not supported by Linux, but again it is featured in the Hardware Browser, without installed drivers.Thanks for your replies.... However i still cant get it to detect the External USB modem. I also have an internal 56k fax modem, but i cannot get that detected either ( maybe its because it was designed for Windows and is not supported ). Im not going to buy a new modem ( I think 2 is more than enough for 1 PC ).It could well be my inexperience with Linux that is making this more difficult, but whatever it is iv just about had enough!! Any last gasp ideas would be welcomeMany ThanksMark--

spamtrap, unless it's a Bugtraq message, in which case I revoke it as that 
account (not as the spamtrap). I'm talking about the situation before I 
checked for Bugtraq in the procmailrc. The message was sent to the spamtrap 
because it was in Razor, then I manually revoked it as the spamtrap because 
it was erroneously reported. The spamtrap is not, and never was, subscribed 
to Bugtraq.cmeclax

The online content business.Dear Friends,The online content business is doing fantastic.
Sound crazy? Perhaps.  With 
advertising, online and off,  taking it on the chin
for the past two years,  online content sites have been shutting down,  laying
off staff and pulling back on their offerings.
However,  this horrible environment
has resulted in an undeniable trend:  content businesses are challenging
people to pay for content.  Finally,  after five years of free,  people are beginning to understand that online,  as in the real
world,  you get what you pay for and they are taking out their credit cards.
 U.S.  consumers spent $675 millionÂ on paidÂ online content last
year,  a 92 percent increase over 2000 spending levels,  according to Online
Publishers Association,  and that figure is expected to increase exponentially
this year.  Look at these success stories:
New York Times Digital has 
been steadily increasing its paid content services over the last year,  and 
registered a 16 percent increase in its total revenues for the latest quarter.
TheStreet.com brought over 
$3 million in subscriptions last quarter,  an increase of almost 50 percent 
over the year-ago quarter.
ConsumerReports.com will 
reach over a million paying subscribers by the end of this year.
RealNetworks' consumer multi-media 
subscription service has more than 750,000 subscribers,  bringing in $17.8 
million in the last quarter.
The Wall Street Journal Online
added over 6,000 new paying customers last quarter,  bringing its subscriber
base to 646,000.
FT.com has signed up 17,000 
subscribers in three months since it launched its premium site in May.
In recognition of this trend we're hosting 
the third installation of our innovative Content Management Summit on October 10, 
2002.  The event charts the changes in the content industry from free 
to paid subscription services,  and the technologies that are enabling the management and monetizing of content.
Our previous Content Management 
Summit (aka Digital Rights Summit) on October 18 last year in New York City 
and January 29 in Los Angeles were unqualified successes.
The Content Management Summit 
III,  taking place in New York at the Millennium Broadway on October 10, 
2002,  will bring together the 100 executives from the leading content and 
distribution firms for a focused day of networking and discovering practical 
solutions.
The event will feature presentations 
from software and services companies providing services
and solutions for selling,  distributing,  managing,  and protecting content.
We're thrilled that 
Microsoft,  TeleKnowledge,  eMeta,  and Liquify will all be demonstrating 
their latest products and services.
The event will also feature six intimate round tables focusing on various aspects of online content.
 These panels are meant to provide an informal forum to discuss the challenges
facing these specific vertical markets,  the changes in the sectors since
the dot-com downfall,  and best practices in the industry.  The panels will
feature leading practitioners in each sector,  and will also include an interactive
question and answer session with the audience.
Among the round table topics will be:
Weblogs:  how they are affecting big media 
companies,  editorially as well as in content delivery/production mechanisms.
Financial news and information 
companies:  how they are using technologies to deliver content to users, 
and how the economics have changed since the stock market downfall.
Business information services 
such as Hoovers,  Lexis-Nexis and others:  best practices in the industry, 
 niche product launches and revenue streams.
Daily news/newspaper companies 
publishing online:  how speed dictates technology choices,  and the move towards
paid content and its implications,  among other issues.
Consumer and entertainment 
publishers:  how do publishers determine the value of entertainment content, 
 the push towards paid subscriptions,  online advertising and other issues.
Join us on October 10th 
for this very important event.  If you are directly responsible 
for content management at a major content site you may qualify for 
a VIP ticket.  Please e-mail your request with your name,  title and bio to
invite@cmsummit.com.  If you are
with a software or services provider,  or anyone not directly responsible 
for the purchase of content management software or solutions,  you can purchase 
a ticket to this event for $1,200 at invite@cmsummit.com.

"re : rto week - - summary of day two morning panel rto week day 3 - - october 17 , 2001 standardizing rto tariffs the morning panel focused on which transmission services should be standardized in rto tariffs across an interconnection or the entire country . there were many diverse views on the panel , and the staff and commissioners were somewhat more engaged in this session . the panelists were : ricky bittle , arkansas electric coop ; jim caldwell , american wind ; peter esposito , dynegy ; rory mcminn , new mexico psc ; glenn ross , dominion resources ; audrey zibelman , xcel energy . general observations this panel had a lot less agreement than the previous panels . dynegy opposes standardization of a transmission tariff and urges ferc to give strong guidance to stakeholders and then let the stakeholders work out the details of a new tariff . dominion advocates a more prescriptive approach by ferc , noting that stakeholders have been unable to reach agreement over the last five years . excel has it ' s own focus - they want to be an itc and want to provide many of the rto services without being an rto . the wind group is mostly concerned about the ability to provide generation on an "" as available "" basis . the commissioner from new mexico does not want standardization , does not want ferc stepping on the state ' s jurisdictional toes , and does not want new mexico ratepayers ' rates to go up . arkansas electric coop insists that spp transmission capacity is full , so if competitors want to move power through spp , new transmission must first be built . i am somewhat concerned that some of the commissioners may believe that tariff standardization is not necessary . while the dynegy concept had merit at one time , it may be too late to rely on the stakeholder process to resolve issues , and it could take many months to go through the process , only to have ferc , in the end , decide the details anyway . we may want to submit comments on this issue to ferc at the conclusion of rto week . what services should be standardized ? overall , dynegy opposes standardizing tariffs but believes certain aspects of reservations should be standardized - - timing , confirmation processing , maintenance issues , bus names , ramping protocols , assumptions for atc calculations , posting times , bumping rules , and settlement time . with regard to congestion management , it should not be standardized between rtos . xcel does not support a standardized tariff but urges ferc to standardize some issues such as cbm calculations , reserve obligations and load balancing and penalties . american wind says ferc must focus on having liquid spot markets in rtos and not worry about tariff standardization . dominion cautions ferc about dynegy ' s proposal to let the industry work out the details . he says this is what happened with order no . 2000 and the industry was unable to work it out . should ferc retain cbm ? ricky ( arkansas coop ) believes that the bigger the rto , the less important cbm is because the rto will have enough resources internally to effectuate reserve sharing . dynegy thinks cbm should be eliminated . dominion thinks cbm should be retained but the rules need to be changed . cbm should not be set for a year - it changes on a daily basis and this should be reflected . nor should cbm be standardized because needs vary region to region . however , because cbm is used for load , the cost of cbm should be allocated to load . all panelists agreed with the concept that if cbm is retained , load should be required to purchase it as a service provided under the tariff . network versus point to point service peter ( dynegy ) discussed the need to develop a new type of transmission service that combines the best features from network and point to point , similar to transportation service offered in gas - - firm and interruptible . peter suggests starting with the crt tariff proposed several years ago . glenn ( dominion ) thinks the crt is outdated and thinks we need a new type of service but agrees that it should combine the best elements of network and point to point . should all transmission service be under the rto ' s tariff ? most of the panelists said yes , all service should be under the tariff , but ricky bittle said there needs to be a transition period - minimum of 5 years , no more than 10 years . commissioner mcminn said no - he sees this as an infringement on the states ' jurisdiction . what services need to be changed under a new rto tariff ? jim ( wind ) believes that the imbalance provisions must be revised so as not to penalize "" as available "" resources . ricky thinks transmission expansion is the most important issue to address in a new tariff . xcel urges ferc to recognize the distinction between rtos and itcs and allow itcs to design and offer their own transmission tariffs . ray alvarez will circulate a summary of the afternoon panel on cost allocation . please let me know if you have any questions . sarah",Safe Email

"Well, for one, it would free up the similar laptop I already got to
just run Amithlon (or if that wasn't so fun, bsd) to run just OpenBSD!This is a near-term thing I could look forward to!However, an 'official' laptop seems unexciting to me with only
the items mentioned.  Most important are the particulars distinguishing
the listed spec from a Dell 2650, preferably:
1- GeForce4 440 Go or newer, pleasingly modern GPU; the
   GeForce2Go (with 16MB video RAM; too little) I have is
   not so much too slow as inefficient; with factory settings it would
   actually crash from running too hot and too fast.
   (Accelerating the Ami* and possibly OpenUAE graphics
   is a necessity to meet for good speed in those environments,
   but an energy-efficient GPU is a good sideeffect and
    portability (read: battery lifetime) enabler.)1.5- Great control over CPU state; by use of 'internet keys'
    wired to BIOS/bhipset routines directly or preferably a scroll
    wheel.  Also, hibernate that works, please.1.7- Bootable to USB 2.0 drives (e.g. larger external ones)
    in BIOS, please.2- P4 Dells overheat.  They have a big heatsink and a little fan
   to pull air through it, and if you don't elevate thelaptop off
   the desk or table or bed it's on, the fan will -stay- on.  Not good
  for MTBS (mean time between service; unless you've got an
  angle on making money on service from Amigans.....)
     One excellent solution is to include a heatpipe which runs
  behind the AMLCD, thus using the backside of the display
  half as a radiator.; though it interferes with the case notion
  below.  (yes, Aavid or such makes some as a standard part.)
      I prefer to include the heatpipe but employ the radiative
  mass in elevating the laptop (i.e. in the form of a catch-handle
  and second logo device behind the laptop, which generally
  provides stow and attachment for elevation legs (move them
  out farther to get to the next-higher ekevation, until the sides
  of the laptop are met.)  This also happens to provide a little
  protection for USB 2  and 1394 cables that I tend to keep
  plugged in all the time (a bit longer port life? Please.) 3- A case color other than brown or black, and preferably (if the
    display module NRE is entirely permissive) the capability to
    -run with the backlight off.-  Again, to save battery power, but
    also as a feature; maybe you remember the iBooks modified
   in this manner.  The user has the privilege to pull out the
   backlight diffuser and fiberoptic lightpipe/CF assembly, with
   its backreflector, and the whole warrantee.  This provides
   for excellent outdoor use, often with the diffuser reinserted
   to keep depth-of-field distractions minimised.
     What would I like?  A1200 putty color, any translucency,
   in or over a rosewood-colored (in KDE color browser, I see
   chocolate, firebrick and a couple of 'indian red' that are great
   candidates) base.  
      I would also like to be able to at least turn off the backlight
    without closing the lid, and to be -able- to fit an -external-
    light source such as a UV-filtered solar collector (and glare
    hood) to feed
    into the backlight.  Not only does this make an excellent 
    color environment but lets one work outdoors tolerably.
      The logo should be a coloration of a
   minimal surface, as the MAA is trying to get me to renew
   with:  demos at http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/pbourke/geometry/
   at first blush.  We'll see what comes out of the contest and
   maybe you'll like the mapping MathCAD does of the
   logo to a minimal surface or manifold that reflects the
   openness of AmigaOS, Ami* and Amiga community.
   MAA.org has more references, I'm sure.4- Obviously Elfin details., e,g, the backlight inlet.Other details:
USB2.x preferred; FireWire would be needed if that's unavailable.
Options like 802.11b or attabhable WiFi hub for ethernet port
should round out the offering.  An option for just-released 
.13 micron P4 (with mobile power features) could make more
reviewers greenlight the series; much better power consumption,
and almost certainly a higher a top clock come with that.
CompactFlash, SmartMedia and MMC flash memory card
interfaces would be very pleasant.  I've mentioned booting to
USB, and booting from CF would be a pleasant extigency also.
To that end, a backup solution with compression using
USB 2 storage or the multimode drive is always a nice 
bundle item; that or a chance to back out a patch under 3 OS.....
Blue skies (and clear water and fresh air): 
Waterproof to 30 feet, 3 Ethernet ports plus onboard WiFi.
Svelte; 3-line frontpanel LCD and bright red pager LED,
builtin G4 cellphone functions, choice of side and 
frontpanel trim: Ivory-like stuff inscribed with M68k memory map
and various OS 3.9 structures or textured fur that
says 'This is Amiga Speaking' when stroked 'round. 
Decent keyboard, as in Toshiba or IBM laptops; perhaps 
an ergonomic fingerworks.com device (they work as 
keyboard and mouse) as the keyboard/trackpad.
2 Directional planar mics atop AMLCD; soundcard with multiple 
18 bit A-D and noise reduction DSP that work in our
(second-through-fourth, at least) favorite OS.
Actual 7"" bellows pulls out at nominal ventilation 
fan location for real void-comp (the test in Blade
Runner) style cooling and extended bass; active cooling
and airfiltering is available to adjust humidity at user
seat and provide mineral water.
HyperTransport ports.

"var david , during today ' s var coordination meeting we had a discussion of issues related to mapping of the forward price curves into core locations . mapping is a necessity dictated by the limitations of the computer system : we have to reduce the dimensionality of the problem to stay within the bounds of available cpu memory . also , in some cases the quality of price discovery is poor and it ' s difficult to model the price curves independently : we solve the problem by mapping them into more liquid and better behaved core locations curves . we have agreed on the following : 1 . winston will investigate the it side and determine to what extent we can increase the number of forward price curves that are simulated as basic ( core ) curves . he will investigate the impact of a larger number of the core curves on the time required to complete the var run . 2 . the curves associated with the biggest 10 - 20 positions in each commodity should be modeled as core curves ( i . e . no mapping into other locations ) . it makes sense to monitor the biggest risks separately and avoid aggregating them into less transparent aggregates . 3 . the results of an automated clustering ( mapping ) procedures should be systematically monitored by a human and corrected if they misrepresent the risks of the trading positions . this responsibility should be vested with one person ( right now the responsibility is dispersed through the organization and this means in practice that nobody is responsible ) . research can allocate one person to this task ; cooperation of trading and rac will be critical . vince",Safe Email

Here is what our customers are saying about the Temple â€œ3â€ Ragga Dagga (TM) phenomenon:â€œTo whom it may concern,I was skeptical when I first read your ad.  I grew up in the 70â€™s & 80â€™s.  I was a hard core (alternative smoker) then.  So I knew my stuff.  But drug tests stopped that!  Now I am disabled from a degenerative muscle, ligament, and tendon disease.  I was smoking (an illegal product) for the pain and nausea.  Now I have something just as good; Temple 3, but cheaper, and it is legal!  I also have a lot of trouble sleeping, but the Capillaris Herba made into tea works and smells great!  Your products that I tried so far, are as good or better than your ads say!  That is hard to find nowadays in a company.  Who ever put this stuff together is a botanical genius.  I will be a customer for life!  Also, I talked with a lady on the phone when I was ordering, and asked her to find out if I could get my products and samples to hand out for free.  And just send the customers to you.  Or get a discount on products that I could sell retail to people.  I would prefer the earlier one becau!
se, I can just talk about your products, I am a great salesman (about 10 years experience), I could hand out flyers, give out little 1 gram pieces as samplers with your business card enclosed, etc.. I am going to be unable to work a regular job for a while, maybe indefinitely?  This deal would give me my own products and samples for free?  You would get free advertising, word of mouth, samples into peoples hands to try, someone that is very good with computers, someone who studied about mail order, Internet, cold calling, small business, good with people, etc..  I would like to be doing something, even if I would get on Social Security Disability.  It is very disheartening not being able to work to support my 2 teenage boys, or do a lot of the things I used to do!  At least I would be able to do something worthwhile.  And great products makes it real easy to sell.  Let me know what you think?Sincerely,RJâ€Location: Midwest, U.S.A.â€œThank you so much for the Ragga.  It is everything you guys claim, and then some!  I was a bit skeptical when I read your description of its effects, but there is literally no exaggeration in your advertisements.  How nice that this is non-prohibited!  It tastes great and feels great too!  I am so glad I took a chance and ordered.  Blessings to all of you.â€-- Frankie R.Location: West Coast, USAâ€œIâ€™m a man of my 40â€™s and I really know my stuff.  I donâ€™t drink or do illegal drugs anymore and have found a much more spiritual path.  I used to have to take Valium in the past.  Not anymore with the Temple â€œ3â€.  It really amazes me how this stuff tastes like the Lebanese and blonde stuff I used to smoke in the 70â€™s.  I am very satisfied with all of your products.  I like them a lot and will be a customer for life for sure.  Whoever makes this stuff is an ARTIST at it.  Who would have thought?!â€  -- A.J.Location: United Kingdom

180 MUST-KNOW TECH TERMS Anyone who's ever been asked to explain a 
tech term only to be left stumbling through a plausible explanation will 
appreciate this eBook. From relevant computing personalities, to obscure 
tech references, to clear descriptions of day-to-day definitions you may 
already know (but not know how to define). These 180 definitions will leave 
you talking the talk of the office geek without giving up your entire social 
calendar to extended sessions in front of a CRT. Even with the refresh rate 
bumped up to 100Hz. 
Download This Tech-Glossary Today!When I was in Omaha a couple of weeks ago, I made the 
unfortunate mistake of driving through the intersection of 
90th and Dodge. Those of you in Omaha know what sorts of 
things I was muttering under my breath during the ordeal. Is 
it possible to suffer from road rage when you're not moving? 
Omaha has started a 10 
year project on Dodge street, which more or less divides 
the city in half east to west. The traffic tie-ups due to 
the construction disaster at 90th and Dodge are being felt 
by nearby businesses. A bank 
is fighting back in a creative way, replacing random $20 
and $10 bills in their ATM machine with $50 and $20 notes 
respectively to reward lucky customers for their patronage. 
And I just drove right by the place.The route to Des Moines from Waterloo isn't much better 
right now as they widen highway 330/65 to 4 lane between 
Marshalltown and Des Moines. Once that's done, it will cut 
20-30 minutes from the trip, and judging from the progress 
they've been making, it won't be too much longer. That's 
probably the fastest moving highway construction I've seen 
during my travels throughout Iowa over the years. As you 
travel to Gnomedex 
from all manner of locales, be sure to keep tabs on 
construction at this handy 
site put up by the Iowa Department of Transportation. See You in Des Moines,Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Randy NielandÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â GnomeNETWORK
Microsoft L2TP/IPSec VPN Client
http://www.microsoft.com/windows2000/server/evaluation/news/bulletins/l2tpclient.asp
Microsoft L2TP/IPSec VPN Client is a free download that 
allows computers running Windows 98, Windows Millennium 
Edition (Me), or Windows NTï¿½ Workstation 4.0 to use Layer 
Two Tunneling Protocol (L2TP) connections with Internet 
Protocol security (IPSec). The combination of L2TP and 
IPSec, known as L2TP/IPSec, is a highly secure technology 
for making remote access virtual private network (VPN) 
connections across public networks such as the Internet. 
Microsoft L2TP/IPSec VPN Client also provides support for 
IPSec Network Address Translator (NAT) traversal.

Iomega Intros 750MB Zip
http://www.iomega.com/zip
I've all but ditched Zip drive use entirely due to cost 
and small capacity. I know many people that still use Zip 
drives, and I still play with a 1GB Jaz drive from time to 
time, but with the ease and low cost of CD-RW drives and 
media, Zip just hasn't stood a chance. Now that Iomega has 
bumped the capacity to 750MB, employed USB 2.0 and pushed 
the speed of the drives significantly higher, maybe it's 
still worth a look for those that need a fast removable 
media option. I'll stick with CD-RW myself. I'll sacrifice 
some speed for the reliability of optical media. But that's 
just me.

Technical Overview of .NET File Services
http://www.microsoft.com/windows.netserver/techinfo/overview/file.mspx
.NET Server is more than Windows 2000 with a look of 
Windows XP, of that you can be sure. Common sense has 
finally won, with the developers delivering many more 
command line tools to manage core services. Of course, this 
isn't the only thing being brought to the .NET table. 
Improvements in DFS, defrag, chkdsk and EFS just scratch the 
surface. New WHQL processes are being established for 
antivirus products, allowing them to hook directly into the 
OS. Virtual Disk Service, Volume Shadow Copy Service and 
promised improvements in the File Replication Service should 
make managing storage easier and more flexible. Â GnomeSTUFF
P4 Performance Goes to Court
http://www.pcworld.com/news/article/0,aid,104075,tk,dn081602X,00.asp
A class action lawsuit has been filed in California by a 
small group of PC owners that are miffed about the 
performance, or lack thereof, that was promised by Intel, HP 
and Gateway. Since the day the P4 was introduced, the 
overall performance has been criticized, so this would seem 
to be more an issue of failing to do proper due diligence on 
the part of the customer, if you ask me. This is one of 
those subjective questions that will come down to fancy 
lawyers and luck of the jury pool draw. If they believed 
everything the TV commercials had to say, then the litigants 
got what they had coming. One beer tastes better than the 
next, only one car can save your life in a crash, etc. This 
general lag in P4 muscle has been publicized since day one, 
as have crash test results on the part of the government and 
third-party organizations. Should we be suing auto makers 
when someone dies in a 5-star rated vehicle? That Volvo will 
save your life, ya know. Does this set an unreasonable 
expectation? Only if you consider advertising an education. Recommend It!http://www.lockergnome.com/issues/techspecialist/20020819.html

">>From the BBC website - www.bbc.co.uk Tuesday, 8 October, 2002, 09:43 GMT 10:43 UK  Fake bank website cons victims
 
 West African criminals have used a fake version of a British bank's online
 service to milk victims of cash, say police. The fake site was used to squeeze
 more money out of people they had already hooked. 
 
 The site has been shut down. But UK National Criminal Intelligence Service,
 (NCIS), said at least two Canadians had lost more than $100,000 after being
 taken in by the fake website. 
 
 The scam behind the fake web domain was the familiar one that offers people a
 share of the huge sums of money they need moved out of various African
 nations. 
 
 NCIS said the use of the web was helping the conmen hook victims that would
 otherwise spot the scam. 
 
 Convincing site 
 
 News of this latest scam was revealed by BBC Radio5Live. It found that an
 unclaimed web domain of a UK bank had been used by conmen to get more cash out
 their victims.  A NCIS spokesman said the domain looked legitimate because it had ""the"" in
 front of the bank's name. 
 
 ""I have seen the microsite myself and it's very sophisticated,"" said the NCIS
 spokesman. ""It's very convincing especially to people not very experienced
 online."" 
 
 Once the con was discovered it was quickly shut down. However, the people
 behind it have not been caught. 
 
 NCIS does know that at least two people have lost more than $100,000. 
 
 The bank involved has bought up the domain used in the con as well as many
 other permutations of its name to limit the chance it could happen again.  Domain games 
 
 Usually people are first hooked in to what has become known as Advanced Fee or
 419 fraud by replying to an unsolicited fax or e-mail offering a share of any
 cash successfully moved out of Africa. 
 
 The '419' refers to the part of the Nigerian penal code dealing with such
 crimes. 
 
 Like any con, there is no money to be moved at all and instead anyone taking
 the bait is asked to pay increasingly large sums to supposedly bribe
 uncooperative officials and to smooth the passage of the cash. 
 
 Although this con has been practiced for years, people still fall victim to
 it. 
 
 NCIS estimates that up to five Americans are sitting in hotel lobbies in
 London everyday waiting to meet people connected with this con. 
 
 Cutting edge fraud 
 
 Often the conmen provide fake banking certificates to give the con an air of
 legitimacy. 
 
 
 People tricked into clicking on fake sites
 
 But a spokesman for NCIS said fake or spoof websites are now being used in
 place of the certificates. 
 
 ""To many people nowadays the cutting edge of banking technology is web
 technology,"" said the spokesman. 
 
 One of the first groups of conmen to use this method set up a fake website
 that supposedly gave victims access to accounts held at the South African
 Reserve Bank, the country's national bank. 
 
 Typically, victims are given a login name and password and are encouraged to
 visit the site so they can see that the cash they are getting a share of has
 been deposited in their name. 
 
 But before they can get their hands on the cash, the victims are typically
 asked to hand over more of their own money to help the transfer go ahead. 
 
 Once the South African police discovered the ruse they declared it a national
 priority crime and soon arrested the 18 people behind it. 
 
 Modern gloss 
 
 An briefing paper prepared by NCIS in August on organised crime noted that
 criminals were increasingly turning to the web to lure new victims and give
 old cons a modern gloss. 
 
 The NCIS spokesman urged people who have fallen victim to 419 fraud to come
 forward and help it track down the perpetrators. He said in the last two
 months it had arrested 24 people overseas involved with this type of fraud. 
 
 He said any e-mail, fax or letter making an offer that looks to good too be
 true, undoubtedly is. 
 
 One of the first companies to fall victim to website spoofing was net payment
 service Paypal. 
 
 Conmen set up a fake site and asked people to visit and re-enter their account
 and credit card details because Paypal had lost the information. 
 
 The website link included in the e-mail looked legitimate but in fact directed
 people to a fake domain that gathered details for the conmen's personal use.

0. INTROHello SourceForge.net Users,This week we've made a big announcement.  As you likely know, any
large dynamic website is powered by a database that funnels data to
the web servers serving data which ultimately gets sent to you.
These databases manage everything from user authentication, session
management, site searching, etc.  SourceForge.net is a database-
dependent website.Today we have announced that we are moving SourceForge.net to DB2,
a powerful relational database by IBM.  We are doing this because
the site continues to grow at a rapid rate, with 700 new users and
70 new projects a day, and we need a database that can handle this
growth.  We feel that DB2 can do this for us, and IBM is giving us
the resources to make this transition successful.  You can read the
press release here:http://www.vasoftware.com/news/press.php/2002/1070.htmlHow will this effect you?  In the first phase, you won't see much
difference other then the site will continue to grow and the
SourceForge.net team will be able to handle the growth.  In later
phases you will see new features on the site that take advantage of
the databases advanced capabilities.Today our mail archives have been converted over.  The rest of the
site will make the migration to DB2 in the coming months.If you have questions about this or any other aspect of the site,
please feel free to email me, pat@sourceforge.net.  I always
appreciate the feedback.Thank you for your continued support of SourceForge.net and the
Open Source Community.Pat-Patrick McGovern
Director, SourceForge.net1. INCREASED DOWNLOAD CAPACITYSourceForge.net continues to grow, and it's appetite for bandwidth
is never-ending.  Every day SF.NET serves over 300,000 files to
ensure that developers and end-users within the Open Source
community can always obtain the software released by hosted
projects, SourceForge.net maintains a network of high-capacity
download servers.  These servers are located throughout the world,
as to provide better download times regardless of which network
provider you are using, and regardless of your geographic location.Three new download servers have recently been added to our network,
further strengthening our file serving capabilities.  These latest
additions include servers hosted by:Time Warner Telecom (Wisconsin,USA);

replies that look like this:  ""Hey!! I didn't subscribe to this list!!!
You spammer. I hate you!  I hate your dog!  (insert other colorful
phrases here)"".  The truth is, when you registered on SourceForge.net
there was a check box that said ""Receive Site-wide updates, low
volume"".  You left it checked when you submitted the registration form,
hence you are receiving this email.  We send these updates every 4 to 6
weeks, so it truly is low volume.  However if you want off, this is not
a problem.  Simply click on the link below.

( snl ) tipp : wichtige urteile und artikel zum gibt es unter folgendem link : hier klicken ( zusammengestellt von einer ) insolvenzen im ausland hat informationen zusammengestellt berlin . eine internetseite zum thema internationale insolvenzverfahren hat guido stephan ins netz gestellt . wer mehr über ausländische gesetze , formulare und literaturtipps wissen will , sollte sich mal auf seine homepage klicken . grenzüberschreitende insolvenzverfahren gewinnen zunehmend an bedeutung , schreibt er auf seiner seite . für die bundesrepublik deutschland sei es als exportnation wichtig , wie deutsche unternehmen ihre rechte in der insolvenz des ausländischen geschäftspartners geltend machen können . auch bei einem im inland eröffneten insolvenzverfahren sei es von interesse , wie ausländisches vermögen des gemeinschuldners für ein inländisches verfahren verwertet werden kann . ( snl ) erreicht wird sein angebot unter der adresse http : / / www . inso - international . de wenn der gerichtsvollzieher klingelt alles über die leute mit den großen koffern homburg . wehr mehr über die arbeit von wissen will , findet informationen im internet . eine interessante seite hat der homburger gerichtsvollzieher roger zimmermann online gestellt . er schreibt über die arbeitsweisen , handwerkszeuge und sogar über ausbildungsstätten seiner kollegen . ( snl ) die homepage findet man unter http : / / www . der - gerichtsvollzieher . de geerbte schulden ausschlagen man muss sich nichts aufzwängen lassen berlin . stirbt ein familienmitglied , hat man es oft nicht nur mit trauer zu tun . war die person zum zeitpunkt des todes verschuldet , gehen die verpflichtungen auf die erben über . schulden und können einen schnell ruinieren . es gibt aber wege , das ungewollte erbe auszuschlagen . jedoch ist tempo gefordert : sechs wochen nach dem tod des angehörigen muss beim nachlassgericht oder einem notar eine erklärung abgeben werden , dass man die erbschaft ausschlägt . auch wenn sich erst nach sechs wochen herausstellt , dass der verstorbene nur schulden hinterlassen hat , hat man noch die möglichkeit das erbe anzufechten . wieder muss man innerhalb von sechs wochen handeln . grund für die anfechtung ist dann , dass sie sich über eine wesentliche eigenschaft des erbes geirrt haben - in diesem fall der schuldenberg . die frist bricht an , wenn man von der Überschuldung erfährt . sind beide fristen verstrichen , muss man einen antrag auf nachlassverwaltung / nachlassinsolvenz stellen . das kann man tun , wenn das erbe die schulden nicht abdeckt . den antrag kann man beim nachlassgericht stellen , bei dem der verstorbene zuletzt seinen wohnsitz angegeben hatte . wenn noch genug geld da ist , zahlt das gericht die ansprüche der gläubiger aus dem betrag . reicht das geld nicht einmal zur deckung der kosten des , wird das verfahren wegen fehlender masse eingestellt . auch dann muss man selbst nichts bezahlen : wird man dennoch von einem nachlassgläubiger genervt , kann man sich an einen anwalt oder die verbraucher - zentrale wenden . ( snl ) muss man an inkassobüros zahlen ? aufmerksame kontrolle der forderung ist wichtig berlin . viele gläubiger wollen mit hilfe von inkassobüros an ihre geld kommen . das ist besonders schwer für die schuldner , denn bekanntermaßen üben diese unternehmen oft dubiosen psychischen druck auf die menschen aus . man sollte sich davon nicht beeinflussen lassen und sein schon knappes konto noch weiter belasten . oft reichen die raten an inkassobüros nicht einmal für die deckung laufender kosten wie zinsen . so wird die forderung nicht weniger , sondern kann weiter ansteigen . auch erkennen sie mit einer zahlung die forderung juristisch an und man verzichtet auf eine mögliche verjährung . Überprüfen sie immer die forderungen , die das inkassounternehmen einziehen will . machen sie etwaige einwände sofort vor der zahlung geltend , sonst erkennen sie die forderung an . inkassobüros dürfen mit entsprechender genehmigung außergerichtlich fremde forderungen einziehen . man sollte sich daher stets die oder eine vollmacht , die der ursprüngliche gläubiger ausgestellt hat , zeigen lassen . kann das büro dem nicht nachkommen , leisten sie nur an ihren gläubiger und nicht an das inkassobüro . nicht zahlen muss man , wenn man den gläubiger rechtzeitig vor beauftragung des über die informiert hat . der darf dann wegen seiner die kosten durch einschaltung eines nicht unnötig erhöhen . einige beispiele aus der rechtsprechung : haben sie mit dem inkassobüro eine ratenzahlung vereinbart , darf hierfür keine  vergleichsgebühr "" abgerechnet werden . ( lg berlin juristisches büro 1988 / 545 ) pro mahngebühr darf ein inkassounternehmen nur die ungefähren portokosten berechnen . dies gilt allerdings nur , wenn es sich z . b . um forderungen aus warenlieferungen handelt . ( olg hammrr njw 1992 / 444 und olg stuttgart rr njw 1988 / 1082 ) bei forderungen aus krediten dürfen neben verzugszinsen keine mahngebühren geltend gemacht werden .

open-source some time in 2000, so my information likely was correct
at the time I compiled that list.In addition, please note that, just because a company decides to go open
source with a codebase as of some new release version, that doesn't make
all versions ever released open source retroactively.  A licence
attaches to a _copy_ of a creative work.  So, if there was a
proprietary, non-redistributable copy in SuSE boxed sets, it's still
proprietary and non-redistributable -- unless SAP AG decided to mail out
a separate permission grant for it.

"letter from : daniel kabila letter from : daniel kabila investment offer . dear , in appreciation of your esteemed contact received through a reliable source and the choice of your country i wish to introduce myself , i am daniel kabila the son of the late drc president laurent desire kabila of the blessed memory . i know this letter might come to you as a surprise but i honestly do not intend to surprise you . i write this letter in respect of my intention to invest the sum of us $ 12 m ( twelve million united state dollars ) with you . i inherited this money from my mother . this money was got through the smuggling and sales of diamond and timber when my father was the head of state . my mother though not her legal wife used her privilege position to engage in the business of diamond and timber since she knows that her survival will depend on how much she can get out of the privilege situation . when my father was assassinated on 16 th jan . 01 by one of his bodyguards lt . rashidi kasereke through the conspiracy of some top army officers that wanted to topple him i escaped to sa because of the fear that i might be arrested by my half brother lt . general joseph kabila the present head of state . actually his mother and my mother are not in the best of relationship because of who among them will be the first lady tussle and this ultimately affected us their children . considering the relationship between sa and my country ' s new government , my mother advised me to leave for sa for security reason , while the funds were deposited with a security company abroad . on getting to there where i have been living since then as a political refugee i am seeking for a reliable foreigner who can assist me in moving this money out for safe banking and profitable investment . honestly i contacted you because i don ' t want to invest this money in here due to my status here as a political refugee . and moreover i wouldn ' t want to take risk because this money is all that i and my mother is depending on because my half brother has seized all my father ' s assets and money and left i and my mother empty handed without knowing about this funds deposited at the security company in abroad so that is why i decided that investing this money abroad should be the best investment for me . i will be honored if i can be given the privilege of investing this money with your help . in view of this plight , i expect you to be trustworthy and kind enough to respond to this distress call to save my mother and i from a hopeless future . and if you agree , i hereby agree to compensate your sincere and candid effort in this regard with 15 % of the total money and annual 5 % of the after tax returns on investment for the first three years . thereafter , the term shall be varied . 5 % for expenses , which may arise during the transaction ( fax and phone bills inclusive ) . when the money is moved into your discrete account , you will be allowed to draw 15 % in your favor , while the remaining 80 % will be invested meaningfully for our future if possible in your area of business and deterrents sectors of the economy in your country which are dividends yielding . whatever your decision is please reach me immediately through my email , and keep this letter tight secret for the interest of my family . best regards , daniel kabila",Phishing Email

Absolutely, to buy a machine and hope later that linux will take to it is

You make it sound that incompatibility has been deliberately built into the
new systems. The products that any company sell with linux installed will be
easily reinstalled with linux. The products sold with Windows only may not
be. Having said that I've never found a Dell system it was impossible to put
RH on. I have had one or two headaches in the past doing it, though.steve

"small cap stox can sizzle the contact center industry few people today know exactly what a contact center does . its predecessor , the call center , brings to mind large telemarketing operations with people calling your house during dinner time . but the fact is that the contact center is much more than that . we see 800 numbers everywhere - the back of our credit cards , the fast food drive - thru window , i ' ll bet even your bottle of water has a phone number to call with questions . the fact is that wherever there is an 800 number , there is a person answering the call . not just a person , but millions of people in north america alone , across a staggering 76 , 000 + contact centers . it used to be the contact center only handled inbound customer service calls and outbound sales calls . that was before the proliferation of the internet - now these same customer service reps are waiting for our phone calls , our faxes , our emails and our web chats . we can call from our offices , home phones , cell phones - even from our computers - americans generate hundreds of millions of transactions each year for contact centers and the industry has grown by leaps and bounds . so aggressive is the growth that today , we are as likely to get someone in california to answer our call as we are to get someone in india . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * contact centers in north america handle millions of transactions each year . for each type of transaction there is a technology that supports it . automatic call distributors for inbound calls , interactive voice response systems ( the dreaded "" press 1 "" ) for self service , email and web servers . in the midst of all of this disparate technology , contact centers began to lose track of a very important piece of their puzzle : information . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * the contact center industry is one of the most data intensive industries . think about it - even if you order a pair of shoes , the contact center has your name , phone number , mailing address , billing address , credit card information , etc . the contact center also has information on each and every one of their employees and all of their activity . every call they received , how long they talked , how long they placed people on hold , how many calls were transferred . until now , no single piece of technology can track information on all people regarding all activities , for one simple reason . the activities are all generated and tracked by different technologies . human science systems , inc . ( hmns ) company overview : human science systems , inc . ( pink sheets : hmns ) is a contact center software development firm . its flagship product , central authorityt serves one main purpose : to be a single point of contact for all data generated in the contact center . central authorityt can track and disseminate all data generated in the contact center , regardless of the technology where the data originated . central authorityt is a contact center resource management ( ccrmt ) product . ccrm is the act of managing data regarding all human , physical and technical resources within the contact center . contact center resources can all be categorized under four distinct umbrellas : employees , technology , capacity , and clients . it may be hard to believe , but the reality is that all functions within the contact center fall under one of those four categories , and our company has come up with a method and a technology that allows departments to easily exchange and leverage valuable data on a real - time basis . "" * why hmns should be on your radar : 1 . datamonitor states that the us contact center market reached a volume of 76 , 000 contact centers in 2001 and that by the end of 2006 that number will exceed 79 , 600 contact centers . 2 . contact center reporting and data tracking has always been burdensome , more so with the incorporation of the various technologies required to successfully compete in the industry . 3 . today ' s contact center requires a responsiveness that can only be achieved with timely and accurate insight into business conditions , but this is not easily accomplished in the absence of methods and technology to easily collect data from numerous disparate sources . 4 . contact centers are looking to replace manual or semi - automated methods of data collection and dissemination because they are not only burdensome , but highly inaccurate and complex . 5 . hmns principals have an established track record as industry experts going back over 15 years and have high level contacts in all of the top tier contact centers . top tier contact centers generate over $ 100 million per year within the north american market . 6 . hmns has patentable methods and technologies and recently retained a well known technology patent attorney to process its applications for the protection of its intellectual property . 7 . a recent report by empire research associates stated that the company could achieve rapid market share penetration in the contact center industry market segment and that a 5 % market share level in five years would be plausible . with a mere 5 % market share , a 40 % sales margin ( fully taxed ) would imply $ 10 million of net income in 2010 . in that event , the report noted that on the present 17 . 6 million shares , earnings would exceed $ 0 . 50 per share . the report concluded that "" the target market is large and enticing to hmns and we believe the company ' s product has a good chance of hitting it !

Some Friends, Indeed, Do More Harm Than GoodSeptember 10, 2002
By MARY DUENWALD 
 Friends are supposed to be good for you. In recent years,
scientific research has suggested that people who have
strong friendships experience less stress, they recover
more quickly from heart attacks and they are likely to live
longer than the friendless. They are even less susceptible
to the common cold, studies show. But not all friends have such a salutary effect. Some lie,
insult and betray. Some are overly needy. Some give too
much advice. Psychologists and sociologists are now calling
attention to the negative health effects of bad friends. ""Friendship is often very painful,"" said Dr. Harriet
Lerner, a psychologist and the author of ""The Dance of
Connection."" ""In a close, enduring friendship, jealousy,
envy, anger and the entire range of difficult emotions will
rear their heads. One has to decide whether the best thing
is to consider it a phase in a long friendship or say this
is bad for my health and I'm disbanding it."" Another book, ""When Friendship Hurts,"" by Dr. Jan Yager, a
sociologist at the University of Connecticut at Stamford,
advises deliberately leaving bad friends by the wayside.
""There's this myth that friendships should last a
lifetime,"" Dr. Yager said. ""But sometimes it's better that
they end."" That social scientists would wait until now to spotlight
the dangers of bad friends is understandable, considering
that they have only recently paid close attention to
friendship at all. Marriage and family relationships -
between siblings or parents and children - have been seen
as more important. Of course, troubled friendships are far less likely to lead
to depression or suicide than troubled marriages are. And
children are seldom seriously affected when friendships go
bad. As a popular author of relationship advice books, Dr.
Lerner said, ""Never once have I had anyone write and say my
best friend hits me."" Dr. Beverley Fehr, a professor of psychology at the
University of Winnipeg, noted that sociological changes,
like a 50 percent divorce rate, have added weight to the
role of friends in emotional and physical health. ""Now that a marital relationship can't be counted on for
stability the way it was in the past, and because people
are less likely to be living with or near extended family
members, people are shifting their focus to friendships as
a way of building community and finding intimacy,"" said Dr.
Fehr, the author of ""Friendship Processes."" Until the past couple of years, the research on friendship
focused on its health benefits. ""Now we're starting to look
at it as a more full relationship,"" said Dr. Suzanna Rose,
a professor of psychology at Florida International
University in Miami. ""Like marriage, friendship also has
negative characteristics."" The research is in its infancy. Psychologists have not yet
measured the ill effects of bad friendship, Dr. Fehr said.
So far they have only, through surveys and interviews,
figured out that it is a significant problem. The early
research, Dr. Fehr added, is showing that betrayal by a
friend can be more devastating than experts had thought. How can a friend be bad? Most obviously, Dr. Rose said, by
drawing a person into criminal or otherwise ill-advised
pursuit. ""When you think of people who were friends at
Enron,"" she added, ""you can see how friendship can support
antisocial behavior."" Betrayal also makes for a bad friendship. ""When friends
split up,"" said Dr. Keith E. Davis, a professor of
psychology at the University of South Carolina, ""it is
often in cases where one has shared personal information or
secrets that the other one wanted to be kept confidential.""
Another form of betrayal, Dr. Yager said, is when a friend
suddenly turns cold, without ever explaining why. ""It's
more than just pulling away,"" she said. ""The silent
treatment is actually malicious."" At least as devastating is an affair with the friend's
romantic partner, as recently happened to one of Dr.
Lerner's patients. ""I would not encourage her to hang in
there and work this one out,"" Dr. Lerner said. A third type of bad friendship involves someone who insults
the other person, Dr. Yager said. One of the 180 people who
responded to Dr. Yager's most recent survey on friendship
described how, when she was 11, her best friend called her
""a derogatory name."" The woman, now 32, was so devastated
that she feels she has been unable to be fully open with
people ever since, Dr. Yager said. Emotional abuse may be less noticeable than verbal abuse,
but it is ""more insidious,"" Dr. Yager said. ""Some people
constantly set up their friends,"" she explained. ""They'll
have a party, not invite the friend, but make sure he or
she finds out."" Risk takers, betrayers and abusers are the most extreme
kinds of bad friends, Dr. Yager said, but they are not the
only ones. She identifies 21 different varieties. Occupying
the second tier of badness are the liar, the person who is
overly dependent, the friend who never listens, the person
who meddles too much in a friend's life, the competitor and
the loner, who prefers not to spend time with friends. Most common is the promise breaker. ""This includes everyone
from the person who says let's have a cup of coffee but
something always comes up at the last minute to someone who
promises to be there for you when you need them, but then
isn't,"" Dr. Yager said. Some friendships go bad, as some romantic relationships do,
when one of the people gradually or suddenly finds reasons
to dislike the other one. ""With couples, it can take 18 to 24 months for someone to
discover there's something important they don't like about
the other person,"" said Dr. Rose of Florida International.
""One might find, for example, that in subtle ways the other
person is a racist. In friendships, which are less intense,
it may take even more time for one person to meet the
other's dislike criteria."" Whether a friendship is worth saving, Dr. Lerner said,
""depends on how large the injury is."" ""Sometimes the mature thing is to lighten up and let
something go,"" she added. ""It's also an act of maturity
sometimes to accept another person's limitations."" Acceptance should come easier among friends than among
spouses, Dr. Lerner said, because people have more than one
friend and do not need a full range of emotional support
from each one. But if the friendship has deteriorated to the point where
one friend truly dislikes the other one or finds that the
friendship is causing undue stress, the healthy response is
to pull away, Dr. Yager said, to stop sharing the personal
or intimate details of life, and start being too busy to
get together, ever. ""It takes two people to start and maintain a friendship,
but only one to end it,"" Dr. Yager said. Friendship, because it is voluntary and unregulated, is far
easier to dissolve than marriage. But it is also
comparatively fragile, experts say. Ideally, the loss of a
bad friendship should leave a person with more time and
appreciation for good ones, Dr. Lerner said. ""It is wise to pay attention to your friendships and have
them in order while you're healthy and your life and work
are going well,"" she said. ""Because when a crisis hits,
when someone you love dies, or you lose your job and your
health insurance, when the universe gives you a crash
course in vulnerability, you will discover how crucial and
life-preserving good friendship is.""http://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/10/health/psychology/10FRIE.html?ex=1032684795&ei=1&en=2a88a6d1b985c977HOW TO ADVERTISE

you say ''Bull'', please read the following. This is the letter you have been 
hearing about on the news lately. Due to the popularity of this letter on the 
Internet, a national weekly news program recently devoted an entire show to the 
investigation of this program described below, to see if it really can make 
people money. The show also investigated whether or not the program was 
legal.Their findings proved once and for all that there are ''absolutely 
NO Laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if people can -follow 
the simple instructions, they are bound to make some money with only $25 out of 
pocket cost''. DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT 
THIS PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED,Â  IT IS

so glad I finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for the 
minimal effort and money required. To my astonishment, I received total

I only made $240.00 but the next 2 months after that I made a total of 
$290,000.00. So far, in the past 8 months by re-entering the program, I have 
made over $710,000.00 and I am playing it again. The key to success in this

appears ON THAT LIST next to the report. MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON 
YOUR ENVELOPE TOP LEFT CORNER in case of any mail problems.=== When

can save them on your computer and resell them. YOUR TOTAL COST $5 X

reports from these 5 different individuals. Save them on your computer so they 
will be accessible for you to send to the 1,000's of people who will order them 
from you. Also make a floppy of these reports and keep it on your desk in case 
something happens to your computer.IMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of 
the people who are listed next to each report, or their sequence on the list, in

ACCURATELY!==========================================================**** 
Take this entire letter, with the modified list of names, and save it on your 
computer. DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES.Save this on a disk as well just 
in case if you loose any data. To assist you with marketing your business on the 
internet, the 5 reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing 
information which includes how to send bulk e-mails legally, where to find 
thousands of free classified ads and much more. There are 2 Primary methods to 
get this venture going:METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL 
LEGALLY==========================================================Let's 
say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and we will assume 
You and those involved send out only 5,000 e-mails each. Let's also assume that 
the mailing receive only a 0.2% response (the response could be much better but 
lets just say it is only 0.2%. Also many people will send out hundreds of 
thousands e-mails instead of only 5,000 each).Continuing with this example, 
you send out only 5,000 e-mails. With a 0.2% response, that is only 10 orders 
for report # 1. Those 10 people responded by sending out 5,000 e-mail 
each for a total of 50,000. Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2% responded with 
orders. That's=100 people responded and ordered Report # 2.Those 100 
people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000 e-mails.Â  The 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders 
for Report # 3.Those 1000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total 
of 5 million e-mails sent out. The 0.2% response to that is 10,000 orders for 
Report # 4.Those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total 
of 50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders 
for Report #5 THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH=$500,000.00 (half 
million).Your total income in this example is: 1..... $50 + 2..... $500 
+ 3..... $5,000 + 4.... $50,000 + 5..... $500,000Â  
Grand Total=$555,550.00NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A 
PENCIL & PAPER AND FIGURE OUT THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW 
YOU CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL MAKE A LOT OF MONEY 
!=========================================================REMEMBER 
FRIENDS, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE ORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED 
TO.Â  Dare to think for a moment what 
would happen if everyone or half or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000 
e-mails each or more? There are over 150 million people on the Internet 
worldwide and counting. Believe me, many people will do just that, and 
more!METHOD #2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE 
INTERNET=======================================================Advertising 
on the net is very very inexpensive and there are hundreds of FREE places to 
advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the Internet will easily get a larger 
response. We strongly suggest you start with Method # 1 and add METHOD # 2 as 
you go along. For every $5 you receive, all you must do is e-mail them the 
Report they ordered. That's it. Always provide same day service on all orders. 
This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out, with your name and address on 
it, will be prompt because they can not advertise until they receive the 
report.=========== AVAILABLE REPORTS ====================ORDER EACH 
REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY. Notes: Always send $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) 
for each Report. Checks NOT accepted. Make sure the cash is concealed by 
wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper. On one of those sheets of paper, 
Write the NUMBER & the NAME of the Report you are ordering, YOUR E-MAIL 
ADDRESS and your name and postal address.PLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE

is moved down on the list, you are placed in front of a Different 
report.You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which report 
people are ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO GENERATE MORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER

information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life, with 
NO RISK and JUST A LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT. You can make more money in the next few 
weeks and months than you have ever imagined. Follow the program EXACTLY AS 
INSTRUCTED. Do Not change it in any way. It works exceedingly well as it is 
now.Remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report after you have put 
your name and address in Report #1 and moved others to #2 ...........# 5 as 
instructed above. One of the people you send this to may send out 100,000 or 
more e-mails and your name will be on every one of them.Â  Remember though, the more you send out 
the more potential customers you will reach. So my friend, I have given you the 
ideas, information, materials and opportunity to become financially independent. 
IT IS UP TO YOU NOW !============ MORE TESTIMONIALS 
================""My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody and I live in 
Chicago. I am an accountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make pretty good 
money. When I received this program I grumbled to Jody about receiving ''junk 
mail''. I made fun of the whole thing,spouting my knowledge of the population 
and percentages involved. I ''knew'' it wouldn't work. Jody totally ignored my 
supposed intelligence and few days later she jumped in with both feet. I made 
merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old ''I told you so'' on her when 
the thing didn't work. Well, the laugh was on me! Within 3 weeks she had 
received 50 responses. Within the next 45 days she had received total $ 
147,200.00 ........... all cash! I was shocked. I have joined Jody in her 
''hobby''.Â  Mitchell Wolf M.D., 
Chicago, 
Illinois======================================================''Not 
being the gambling type, it took several weeks to make up my mind to participate 
in this plan. But conservative that I am, I decided that the initial investment 
was so little that there was just no way that I wouldn't get enough orders to at 
least get my money back''. '' I was surprised when I found my medium size post 
office box crammed with orders. I made $319,210.00in the first 12 weeks. The 
nice thing about this deal is that it does not matter where people live. There 
simply isn't a better investment with a faster return and so big.""Â  Dan Sondstrom, Alberta, 
Canada=======================================================''I 
had received this program before. I deleted it, but later I wondered if I should 
have given it a try. Of course, I had no idea who to contact to get another 
copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed again by someone else.........11 
months passed then it luckily came again...... I did not delete this one! I made 
more than $490,000 on my first try and all the money came within 22 weeks.""Â  Susan De Suza, New York, 
N.Y.=======================================================''It 
really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money with little cost to 
you. I followed the simple instructions carefully and within 10 days the money 
started to come in. My first month I made $20,560.00 and by the end of third 
month my total cash count was $362,840.00. Life is beautiful, Thanx to 
internet."".Â  Fred Dellaca, Westport,

( 1 ) ( a : * ; b : ok ; c : ? ) ( context : my employer is so puritanical that he would fire me if i behaved in what he considered a libertine manner . ) "" even if "" my wife smoked cigarettes , he would fire me , but , since she would n't ever smoke , he won't fire me . comment of a : the ' even if ' clause is ok with with "" he . . . me "" , but the second halfdoesn ' t match . no one would ever phrase this combination of ideas this way . it has a split focus . is the topic the extent of the employer 's puritanism ( first half ) , or the likelihood / unlikelihood of the speaker 's being fired ( second half ) . i find even my japanese colleagues do this split focus thing all the time . such sentences are extremely difficult and often impossible to parse in any natural way . it took several years of familiarity with japanese versions of english for me even to identify what is going on in sentences like this . i 'd love to know an effective way to explain to japanese students of english why this won't work and maybe more important , how to recognize that they ' ve pro9duced an illicit split focus construction . ( 2 ) ( a : ? ? ? ; b : ok ; c : ? ) "" even if "" you drink just a little , your boss will fire you , but , since you sruely won't drink at all , he won't fire you . comment of a : a ) "" "" even if . . . will fire you "" is most easily interpreted as habitual , while "" you surely * won't * drink at all "" would designate a single event in the future . these sit uneasily together . b ) since drinking a lot is antithetical to drinking a little , the last clause must imply that the boss is thinking of firing the addressee for some other reason . in this case , interpeting the first half according to a ) above , there can be no connection between the firing and the drinking and the sentence fails by virtue of non-entailment . on the other hand , if one * goes back * and reinterprets the ' you ' in the first half merely as the addressee , then the sentence might be possible , given that condition b ) abvove represents the real state of affairs . it would also be implied that the boss needs just a little bit more reason to actualy execute the firing . the final clause would sound better with "" can't "" than with "" won't "" , however , in this scenario . ( 3 ) ( a : * * ; b : * ; c : * ) "" even if "" you drink just a little , your boss will fire you , but since you surely drink a lot , he won't fire you . comment of a : the action posited by the "" even if "" clause is already a maximum limit . the sentence is logically impossible . comment of b : but if you continue the sentence as below then it is fine by me .

"" even if "" it rains lightly , the game will be cancelled ; but if it rains heavily , the game will continue . comment of a : nonsense , in order and logic . comment of b : okay if you continue with something like : ( 5 ) ( ok ) if it does n't rain , the game will continue .

( 7 ) ( a : ok ; b : ok ; c : ? ) "" even if "" my wife smoked cigarettes , i would not scold her , but , if she ever broke my favorite dishes , i would scold her . comment of a : "" scold her "" should nto be repeated at the end . very unnatural . ( 8 ) ( a : ? ; b : ? ; c : ? ) "" even if "" my wife smokes cigarettes , i will not scold her , but , if she breaks my favorite dishes , i will scold her . comment of a : underlying logic ok . i do n't like "" even if "" with the indicative present verb because i like to mark conditionals on the verb , but i ' m aware that this usage is in process of change . same proviso as above for the repeated "" scold her .

""60 Minutes II"" Bush Interview:(CBS)Â No president since Abraham Lincoln has seen such horrific loss of 
life in a war on American soil. No president since James Madison, nearly 
200 years ago, has seen the nationâ€™s capital city successfully attacked. 
But, one year ago, President George W. Bush was thrown into the first 
great crisis of the 21st century.This is the presidentâ€™s story of September 11th and the week America 
went to war. 60 Minutes II spent two hours with Mr. Bush, one, on Air 
Force One and another in the Oval Office last week. Even after a year, 
the president is still moved, sometimes to the point of tears, when he 
remembers Sept. 11.â€œI knew, the farther we get away from Sept.11, the more likely it is for 
some around the world to forget the mission, but not me,â€ Mr. Bush says 
during the Air Force One interview. â€œNot me. I made the pledge to myself 
and to people that Iâ€™m not going to forget what happened on Sept. 11. So 
long as Iâ€™m president, we will pursue the killers and bring them to 
justice. We owe that to those who have lost their lives.â€The memories come back sharp and clear on Air Force One, where Pelley 
joined the president for a recent trip across country. 60 Minutes II 
wanted to talk to him there because that is where he spent the first 
hours after the attack.Not since Lyndon Johnson was sworn in on Air Force One has the airplane 
been so central to America in a crisis.For President Bush, Sept. 11 2001, started with the usual routine. 
Before dawn, the president was on his four-mile run. It was just before 
6 a.m. and, at the same moment, another man was on the move: Mohammad 
Atta. Two hours later, as Mr. Bush drove to an elementary school, 
hijackers on four planes were murdering the flight crews and turning the 
airliners east. As the motorcade neared the school at 8:45 a.m., jet 
engines echoed in Manhattan.Atta plunged the 767 jumbo jet into World Trade Center Tower One.â€œI thought it was an accident,â€ says Mr. Bush. â€œI thought it was a pilot 
error. I thought that some foolish soul had gotten lost and - and made a 
terrible mistake.â€Mr. Bush was told about the first plane just before sitting down with a 
class of second graders. He was watching a reading drill when, just 
after nine, United Flight 175 exploded into the second tower. There was 
the sudden realization that what had seemed like a terrible mistake was 
a coordinated attack.Back in the Florida classroom, press secretary Ari Fleischer got the 
news on his pager. The presidentâ€™s chief-of-staff, Andy Card stepped in.â€œA second plane hit the second tower; America is under attack,â€ Card 
told the presidentWhen he said those words, what did he see in the Presidentâ€™s face?â€œI saw him coming to recognition of what I had said,â€ Card recalls. â€œI 
think he understood that he was going to have to take command as 
commander-in-chief, not just as president.â€What was going through Bushâ€™s mind when he heard the news?â€œWeâ€™re at war and somebody has dared attack us and weâ€™re going to do 
something about it,â€ Mr. Bush recalls. â€œI realized I was in a unique 
setting to receive a message that somebody attacked us, and I was 
looking at these little children and all of the sudden we were at war. I 
can remember noticing the press pool and the press corps beginning to 
get the calls and seeing the look on their face. And it became evident 
that we were, you know, that the world had changed.â€Mr. Bush walked into a classroom set up with a secure phone. He called 
the vice president, pulling the phone cord tight as he spun to see the 
attack on TV. Then he grabbed a legal pad and quickly wrote his first 
words to the nation.""Ladies and gentlemen, this is a difficult moment for America,â€ he said 
in the speech. â€œToday, weâ€™ve had a national tragedy.â€It was 9:30 a.m. As he spoke, Mr. Bush didnâ€™t know that two more 
hijacked jets were streaking toward Washington. Vice Pesident Dick 
Cheney was in his office at the White House when a Secret Service agent 
ran in.â€œHe said to me, â€˜Sir, we have to leave immediatelyâ€™ and grabbed, put a 
hand on my belt, another hand on my shoulder and propelled me out the 
door of my office,â€ Cheney recalls. â€œIâ€™m not sure how they do it, but 
they sort of levitate you down the hallway, you move very fast.â€â€œThere wasnâ€™t a lot of time for chitchat, you know, with the vice 
president,â€ says Secret Service Director Brian Stafford, who was in his 
command center ordering the round-up of top officials and the First 
Family. He felt that he had only minutes to work with. â€œWe knew there 
were unidentified planes tracking in our direction,â€ he says.Cheney was rushed deep under the White House into a bunker called the 
Presidential Emergency Operations Center. It was built for war, and this 
was it. On her way down, National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice 
called Mr. Bush.â€œIt was brief because I was being pushed to get off the phone and get 
out of the West Wing,â€ says Rice. â€œThey were hurrying me off the phone 
with the president and I just said, he said, â€˜Iâ€™m coming backâ€™ and we 
said â€˜Mr. President that may not be wise.â€™ I remember stopping briefly 
to call my family, my aunt and uncle in Alabama and say, â€˜Iâ€™m fine. You 
have to tell everybody that Iâ€™m fineâ€™ but then settling into trying to 
deal with the enormity of that moment, and in the first few hours, I 
think the thing that was on everybodyâ€™s mind was how many more planes 
are coming.â€The Capitol was evacuated. And for the first time ever, the Secret 
Service executed the emergency plan to ensure the presidential line of 
succession. Agents swept up the 15 officials who stood to become 
president if the others were killed. They wanted to move Vice President 
Cheney, fearing he was in danger even in the bunker. But Cheney says 
when he heard the other officials were safe, he decided to stay at the 
White House, no matter what.â€œItâ€™s important to emphasize it's not personal, you donâ€™t think of it in 
personal terms, youâ€™ve got a professional job to do,â€ says Cheney.Cheney was joined by transportation secretary Norm Mineta who remembers 
hearing the FAA counting down the hijacked jets closing in on the 
capital.Says Mineta: â€œSomeone came in and said â€˜Mr. Vice president thereâ€™s a 
plane 50 miles out,â€™ then he came in and said â€˜Its now 10 miles out, we 
donâ€™t know where it is exactly, but itâ€™s coming in low and fast.â€™â€It was American Flight 77. At 9:38 a.m., it exploded into the Pentagon, 
the first successful attack on Washington since the War of 1812.As the Pentagon burned, Mr. Bushâ€™s limousine sped toward Air Force One 
in Florida. At that moment, United Flight 93 - the last hijacked plane - 
was taking dead aim at Washington. At the White House, the staff was in 
the West Wing cafeteria, watching on TV. Press Secretary Jennifer 
Millerwise was in the crowd when the order came to evacuate.â€œI no sooner walked outside when someone from the Secret Service yelled 
â€˜Women drop your heels and run, drop your heels and run,â€™ and suddenly 
the gates that never open except for authorized vehicles just opened and 
the whole White House just flooded out,â€ she recalls.In Florida, as Mr. Bush boarded Air Force One, he was overheard telling 
a Secret Service agent â€œBe sure to get the First Lady and my daughters 
protected.â€ At 9:57 a.m., Air Force One thundered down the runway, 
blasting smoke and dust in a full -hrust take off. Communications 
Director Dan Bartlett was on board.â€œIt was like a rocket,â€ he remembers. â€œFor a good ten minutes, the plane 
was going almost straight up.â€At the same moment, 56 minutes after it was hit, World Trade Center 
Tower Two began to falter, then cascade in an incomprehensible avalanche 
of steel, concrete and human lives.â€œSomeone said to me, â€˜Look at thatâ€™ I remember that, â€˜Look at thatâ€™ and 
I looked up and I saw and I just remember a cloud of dust and smoke and 
the horror of that moment,â€ recalls Rice of the TV newscast.She also felt something in her gut: â€œThat weâ€™ve lost a lot of Americans 
and that eventually we would get these people. I felt the anger. Of 
course I felt the anger.â€Down in the bunker, Cheney was trying to figure out how many hijacked 
planes there were. Officials feared there could be as many as 11.As the planes track toward Washington, a discussion begins about whether 
to shoot them down. â€œI discussed it with the president,â€ Cheney 
recalls. â€œâ€˜Are we prepared to order our aircraft to shoot down these 
airliners that have been hijacked?â€™ He said yes.â€â€œIt was my advice. It was his decision,â€ says Cheney.â€œThatâ€™s a sobering moment to order your own combat aircraft to shoot 
down your own civilian aircraft,â€ says Bush. â€œBut it was an easy 
decision to make given the â€“ given the fact that we had learned that a 
commercial aircraft was being used as a weapon. I say easy decision, it 
was, I didnâ€™t hesitate, let me put it that way. I knew what had to be 
done.â€The passengers on United Flight 93 also knew what had to be done. They 
fought for control and sacrificed themselves in a Pennsylvania meadow. 
The flight was 15 minutes from Washington.â€œClearly, the terrorists were trying to take out as many symbols of 
government as they could: the Pentagon, perhaps the Capitol, perhaps the 
White House. These people saved us not only physically but they saved us 
psychologically and symbolically in a very important way, too,â€ says 
Rice.Meanwhile, Tower One was weakening. It had stood for an hour and 43 
minutes. At 10:29 a.m., it buckled in a mirror image of the collapse of 
its twin.The image that went round the world reached the First Lady in a secure 
location somewhere in Washington. â€œI was horrified,â€ she says. â€œI 
thought, â€˜Dear God, protect as many citizens as you can.â€™ It was a 
nightmare.â€By 10:30 a.m., Americaâ€™s largest city was devastated, its military 
headquarters were burning. Air force One turned west along the Gulf 
Coast.â€œI can remember sitting right here in this office thinking about the 
consequences of what had taken place and realizing it was the defining 
moment in the history of the United States,â€ says President Bush. â€œI 
didnâ€™t need any legal briefs, I didnâ€™t need any consultations, I knew we 
were at war.â€Mr. Bush says the first hours were frustrating. He watched the 
horrifying pictures, but the TV signal was breaking up. His calls to 
Cheney were cutting out. Mr. Bush says he pounded his desk shouting, 
â€œThis is inexcusable; get me the vice president.â€â€œI was trying to clear the fog of war, and there is a fog of war, says 
the president. ""Information was just flying from all directions.â€Chief of staff Card brought in the reports. There was word Camp David 
had been hit. A jet was thought to be targeting Mr. Bushâ€™s ranch.â€œI remember hearing that the State Department might have been hit, or 
that the White House had a fire in it. So we were hearing lots of 
different information,â€ says Card.They also feared that Air Force One itself was a target. Cheney told the 
president there was a credible threat against the plane. Using the code 
name for Air Force One, Mr. Bush told an aide, â€œAngel is next.â€ The 
threat was passed to presidential pilot Colonel Mark Tillman.â€œIt was serious before that but now it is -no longer is it a time to get 
the president home,â€ Tillman says. â€œWe actually have to consider 
everything we say, everything we do could be intercepted, and we have to 
make sure that no one knows what our position is.â€Tillman asked for an armed guard at his cockpit door while Secret 
Service agents double-checked the identity of everyone on board. The 
crew reviewed the emergency evacuation plan. Then came a warning from 
air traffic control â€“ a suspect airliner was dead ahead.â€œComing out of Sarasota there was one call that said there was an 
airliner off our nose that they did not have contact with,â€ Tillman 
remembers.Tillman took evasive action, pulling his plane high above normal 
traffic. They were on course for Washington, but by now no one thought 
that was a good idea, except the president.â€œI wanted to come back to Washington, but the circumstances were such 
that it was just impossible for the Secret Service or the national 
security team to clear the way for Air Force One to come back,â€ says 
Bush.So Air Force One set course for an underground command center in 
Nebraska. Back in Washington, the presidentâ€™s closest advisor, Karen 
Hughes, heard about the threat to the plane and placed a call to Mr. 
Bush.â€œAnd the military operator came back to me and in a voice that, to me, 
sounded very shaken said, â€˜Maâ€™am, Iâ€™m sorry, we canâ€™t reach Air Force 
One.â€™â€ Hughes recalls. Hughes was out of the White House during the 
attacks. When she came back, it was a place she didnâ€™t recognize.â€œThere were either military, or maybe Secret Service, dressed all in 
black, holding machine guns as, as we drove up. And I never expected to 
see something like that in, in our nation's capital,â€ says Hughes.When she walked into the White House, no one was inside. â€œI knew it was 
a day that you didn't want to surprise anybody, and so I yelled, 
â€˜Hello?â€™ and two, again, kind of SWAT team members came running, running 
through the, the hall with, again, guns drawn, and then took me to, to 
the location where I met the vice president.â€On Air Force One, Col. Tillman had a problem. He needed to hide the most 
visible plane in the world, a 747 longer than the White House itself. He 
didnâ€™t want to use his radio, because the hijackers could be listening 
to air traffic control. So he called air traffic control on the 
telephone.â€œWe actually didn't tell them our destination or what directions we were 
heading,â€ says Tillman. â€œWe, we basically just talked to 'em and said, 
'OK, fine, we have no clearance at this time, we are just going to fly 
across the United States.'â€Controllers passed Air Force One from one sector to another, warning 
each other to keep the route secret.â€œOK, whereâ€™s he going?â€ one tower radioed to another.â€œJust watch him,â€ a second tower responded. â€œDonâ€™t question him whereâ€™s 
he's going. Just work him and watch him, thereâ€™s no flight plan in and 
weâ€™re not going to put anything in. Ok, sir?â€Air Force One ordered a fighter escort, and air traffic control radioed 
back: â€œAir Force One, got two F-16s at about your 10 oâ€™clock position.â€â€œThe staff, and the president and us, were filed out along the outside 
hallway of his presidential cabin there and looking out the windows,â€ 
says Bartlett. â€œAnd the president gives them a signal of salute, and the 
pilot kind of tips his wing, and fades off and backs into formation.â€The men in the F-16s were Shane Brotherton and Randy Roberts, from the 
Texas Air National Guard. Their mission was so secret their commander 
wouldnâ€™t tell them where they were going.â€œHe just said, 'Youâ€™ll know when you see it,' and that was my first 
clue, I didnâ€™t have any idea what we were going up until that point,â€ 
says Brotherton. He knew when he saw it.â€œWe, we were trying to keep an 80-mile bubble, bubble around Air Force 
One, and we'd investigate anything that was within 80 miles,â€ says 
Roberts.Bush says he was not worried about the safety of the people on this 
aircraft, or for his own safety: â€œI looked out the airplane and saw two 
F-16s on each wing. It was going to have to be a pretty good pilot to 
get us.â€We now know that the threat to Air Force One was part of the fog of war, 
a false alarm. But it had a powerful effect at the time. Some wondered, 
with the president out of sight, was he still running the government? He 
hadnâ€™t appeared after the attack on Washington. Mr. Bush was clearly 
worried about it. At one point he was overheard saying, â€œThe American 
people want to know where their dang president is.â€ The staff considered 
an address to the nation by phone but instead Mr. Bush ordered Air Force 
One to land somewhere within 30 minutes so he could appear on TV. At 
11:45 a.m., they landed at Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana.â€œThe resolve of our great nation is being tested. But make no mistake, 
we will show the world that we will pass this test. God bless,â€ Bush 
said to the nation from Barksdale.At Barksdale, the Secret Service believed the situation in Washington 
was still unsafe. So the plane continued on to Nebraska, to the command 
center where Mr. Bush would be secure and have all the communications 
gear he needed to run the government. Aboard Air Force One, Mr. Bush had 
a job for press secretary Fleischer.â€œThe president asked me to make sure that I took down everything that 
was said. I think he wanted to make certain that a record existed,â€ says 
FleischerFleischerâ€™s notes capture Mr. Bushâ€™s language, plain and unguarded. To 
the vice president he said: â€œWeâ€™re at war, Dick, weâ€™re going to find out 
who did this and kick their ass.â€ Another time, Mr. Bush said, â€œWeâ€™re 
not going to have any slap-on-the-wrist crap this time.â€The President adds, â€œI can remember telling the Secretary of Defense, I 
said, â€˜Weâ€™re going to find out who did this and then Mr. Secretary, you 
and Dick Myers,â€™ who we just named as chairman of the joint chiefs, â€˜are 
going to go get them.â€™â€By 3 p.m., Air Force One touched down at Offutt Air Force Base in 
Nebraska. Mr. Bush and his team were herded into a small brick hut that 
gave no hint of what they would find below.At the bottom of the stairs was the U.S. Strategic Command Underground 
Command Center. It was built to transmit a presidentâ€™s order to go to 
nuclear war. But when Mr. Bush walked in, the battle staff was watching 
the skies over the United States. Many airplanes had still not landed. 
After a short briefing, Mr. Bush and Card were taken to a teleconference 
center which connected them to the White House, the Pentagon, the FBI 
and the CIA. Mr. Bush had a question for his CIA Director George Tenent.According to Rice, Bush asked Tenent who had done this. Rice recalls 
that Tenent answered: â€œSir, I believe its al Qaeda. Weâ€™re doing the 
assessment but it looks like, it feels like, it smells like al Qaeda.â€The evidence would build. FBI Director Robert Mueller says that an 
essential clue came from one of the hijacked planes before it crashed.A flight attendant on American Flight 11, Amy Sweeney, had the presence 
of mind to call her office as the plane was hijacked and give them the 
seat numbers of the hijackers. â€œThat was the first piece of hard 
evidence. We could then go to the manifest, find out who was sitting in 
those seats and immediately conduct an investigation of those 
individuals, as opposed to taking all the passengers on the plane and 
going through a process of elimination,â€ says Mueller.In Nebraska, the White House staff was preparing for an address to the 
nation from the Air Force bunker, but by then the president had had 
enough. He decided to come back.â€œAt one point, he said he didnâ€™t want any tinhorn terrorist keeping him 
out of Washington,â€ Fleischer says. â€œThat verbatim.â€On board, he was already thinking of issuing an ultimatum to the world: 
â€œI had time to think and a couple of thoughts emerged. One was that 
you're guilty if you harbor a terrorist, because I knew these terrorists 
like al-Qaeda liked to prey on weak government and weak people. The 
other thought that came was the opportunity to fashion a vast coalition 
of countries that would either be with us or with the terrorists.â€As Air Force One sped east, the last casualty of the attack on America 
collapsed, one of the nationâ€™s worst days wore into evening. At the 
World Trade Center, 2,801 were killed; at the Pentagon, 184; and in 
Pennsylvania 40. Altogether, there were 3,025 dead.â€œAnybody who would attack America the way they did, anybody who would 
take innocent life the way they did, anybody who's so devious, is evil,â€ 
Bush said recently.Mr. Bush would soon see that evil face to face. After arriving in 
Washington, he boarded his helicopter and flew past the Pentagon on the 
way to the White House.Was there a time when he was afraid that there might not be a White 
House to return to? â€œI donâ€™t remember thinking about whether or not the 
White House would have been obliterated,"" he recalls. ""I think I might 
have thought they took their best shot, and now it was time for us to 
take our best shot.â€Mr. Bush arrived back at the White House nine hours after the attacks. 
His next step was an address to the nation. Karen Hughes and her staff 
were already working on the speech.â€œHe decided that the primary tone he wanted to strike that night was 
reassurance,â€ remembers Hughes. â€œWe had to show resolve, we had to 
reassure people, we had to let them know that we would be OK.â€Just off the Oval Office, Mr. Bush added the words that would become 
known as the Bush Doctrine - no distinction between terrorists and those 
who harbor them. The staff wanted to add a declaration of war but Mr. 
Bush didnâ€™t think the American people wanted to hear it that night and 
he was emphatic about that.He prepared to say it from the same desk where Franklin Roosevelt first 
heard the news of Pearl Harbor. Now Bush was commander in chief. Eighty 
million Americans were watching.â€œToday our fellow citizens, our way of life, our very freedom came under 
attack in a series of deliberate and deadly terrorist acts,â€ he said 
from the Oval Office that night.The Oval Office speech came at the end of the bloodiest day in American 
history since the Civil War. Before he walked to the White House 
residence for the night, Mr. Bush dictated these words for the White 
House daily log: â€œThe Pearl Harbor of the 21st century took place today. 
We think it's Osama bin Laden.â€(CBS)Â When Sept. 12 dawned, President Bush was demanding a war plan. No 
one in the White House or the Pentagon could be sure of what the 
president would do. In office for just eight months, heâ€™d never been 
tested as commander-in-chief.â€œI never asked them what they thought,â€ President Bush said of the 
Pentagon brass, â€œbecause I didnâ€™t really â€“ because I knew what I was 
gonna do. I knew exactly what had to be done, Scott. And that was to set 
a strategy to seek justice. Find out who did it, hunt them down and 
bring them to justice.â€In the cabinet room, the president made clear what was next: â€œThe 
deliberate and deadly attacks which were carried out yesterday against 
our country were more than acts of terror, they were acts of war,â€ he 
said.To the war cabinet, al Qaeda was no surprise. National Security Advisor 
Condoleezza Rice says the administration had been at work on a plan to 
strike bin Ladenâ€™s organization well before Sept. 11.â€œThe president said, â€˜You know Iâ€™m tired of swatting at flies, I need a 
strategy to eliminate these guys,â€™â€ Rice recalls.In one of the worst intelligence failures ever, the CIA and FBI didnâ€™t 
pick up clues that an attack in the United States was imminent. Without 
a sense of urgency, the White House strategy the president had asked for 
came too late.Chief of Staff Andrew Card recalls that the plan Mr. Bush had asked for 
was â€œliterally headed to the presidentâ€™s desk, I think, on the eleventh, 
tenth or eleventh, of September.â€On Sept. 12, the war cabinet was debating the full range of options - 
who to hit and how to hit them. There were some at the Pentagon who 
worried in the early hours that Mr. Bush would order up an immediate 
cruise missile strike, of the kind that had not deterred bin Laden in 
the past.â€œWell, thereâ€™s a lot of nervous Nellies at the Pentagon, anyway,â€ Mr. 
Bush tells Pelley. â€œA lot of people like to chatter, you know, more than 
they should. But no, I appreciate that very much. Secretary of Defense 
(Donald) Rumsfeld early on discussed the idea of making sure we had what 
we called â€˜boots on the ground.â€™ That if youâ€™re gonna go to war, then 
youâ€™ve gotta go to war with all your assets.â€The president says he wanted to â€œfight and win a guerilla war with 
conventional means.â€It was an innovative but risky idea being proposed by CIA Director 
George Tenent. Tenent wanted to combine American technology and 
intelligence with the brute force of Afghan fighters hostile to the 
Taliban government.Secretary of State Colin Powell, noting that the CIA had already 
developed a long relationship with the Afghan resistance, called it an 
unconventional solution to an unconventional problem.â€œAs I like to describe it to my friends,â€ Powell says, â€œwe had on the 
ground a Fourth World army riding horses and living in tents with some 
CIA and special forces with them and we had a First World air force, the 
best in the world. How do you connect it all?â€The president gave them 48 hours to figure it out.Meanwhile, Mr. Bush went to the battlefield himself. Just the day 
before, he had called the Pentagon the â€œmightiest building in the 
world.â€ Now one-fifth of it was in ruins. The wreckage of American 
Flight 77 was being examined by Navy investigators. And before Mr. Bush 
left, he made a point of speaking personally with the team recovering 
the remains of the first casualties of war on his watch.
The next day, Sept. 13, there was another warning of attack that the 
public never heard about. Threats had been were coming in constantly but 
this one sounded credible: a large truck bomb headed to the White House. 
The Secret Service wanted the president back in the bunker.â€œHe wasnâ€™t real receptive to that, to that recommendation,â€ remembers 
Brian Stafford, director of the Secret Service. â€œAnd he ordered a 
hamburger and said he was going to stay in the White House that evening 
and thatâ€™s what he did.â€The next day, would be one of the longest and the most difficult for the 
president. On Friday, Sept. 14, Mr. Bush started the day with a cabinet 
meeting, but he wept when he walked in and was surprised by applause.â€œHe sat down, slightly overcome, for a moment but he recaptured it,â€ 
says Powell who remembers being worried that the president might have 
trouble getting through his speech at the national memorial service 
later that morning.â€œAnd I just scribbled a little note to him,â€ Powell recalls, â€œand I 
said, â€˜Mr. President, Iâ€™ve learned over the years when you are going to 
give a very emotional speech, watch out for certain words that will 
cause you to start to tear up.â€™ He looked at me and he smiled and then 
at the next break in the conversation he said, â€˜The Secretary of State 
told me not to break down at the memorial service,â€™ and that broke the 
tension and everybody started laughing and I felt embarrassed.â€First Lady Laura Bush was involved in planning the memorial service and 
she says she wanted it to be both dignified and comforting. â€œI wanted 
the Psalms and everything to be read to be comforting, because I think 
we were a country, that needed, everyone of us, needed comforting.â€It also stirred the mournersâ€™ resolve, as Rice remember. â€œAs we stood to 
sing the Battle Hymn of the Republic,â€ she says, â€œyou could feel the 
entire congregation and I could certainly feel myself stiffen, the kind 
of spine, and this deep sadness was being replaced by resolve.â€œWe all felt that we still had mourning to do for our countrymen who had 
been lost but that we also had a new purpose in not just avenging what 
had happened to them but making certain that the world was eventually 
going to be safe from this kind of attack ever again.â€Next came a visit to ground zero. The president was not prepared for 
what he encountered there.â€œYou couldnâ€™t brief me, you couldnâ€™t brief anybody on ground zero until 
you saw it,"" Mr. Bush says. â€œIt was like â€“ it was ghostly. Like youâ€™re 
having a bad dream and youâ€™re walking through the dream.â€The president found the scene very powerful, particularly when the men 
and women at ground zero began to chant, â€œUSA! USA!.â€â€œThere was a lot of bloodlust,â€ the president recalls. â€œPeople were, you 
know, pointing their big old hands at me saying, â€˜Donâ€™t you ever forget 
this, Mr. President. Donâ€™t let us down.â€™ The scene was very powerful. 
Very powerful.â€When Mr. Bush tried to speak, the crowd kept shouting, â€œWe canâ€™t hear 
you.â€The president responded, â€œI can hear you. I can hear you. The rest of 
the world hears you. And the people who knocked these buildings down 
will hear all of us soon.â€Mr. Bush had been in New York just a few weeks before; heâ€™d posed with 
the firemen who always stood by whenever the presidentâ€™s helicopter 
landed there. Now, five of the men who stood with the president in the 
picture were dead â€“ lost at ground zero.When the president arrived Sept. 14, Manhattan was papered with the 
faces of the lost. Families, unable to believe that so many had vanished 
in an instant, held onto the hope that their loved ones were just 
missing. It was a place where a child comforted a grieving mother.At a meeting the public never saw, the president spoke with several 
hundred of these families in a convention hall.â€œPeople said to me, â€˜Heâ€™ll come out. Donâ€™t worry, Mr. president, weâ€™ll 
see him soon. I know my loved one, he will - heâ€™ll find a place to 
survive underneath the rubble and weâ€™ll get him out.â€™ I, on the other 
hand had been briefed about the realities, and my job was to hug and 
cry, but I remember the whole time thinking, â€˜This is incredibly sad 
because the loved ones wonâ€™t come out.â€™â€One little boy handed the president a picture of his father in his 
firefighter uniform and as he signed it, Mr. Bush remembers, he told the 
boy, â€œYour daddy wonâ€™t believe that I was here, so you show him that 
autograph.â€It was an effort â€œto provide a little hope,â€ the president recalls. â€œI 
still get emotional thinking about it because weâ€™re dealing with people 
who loved their dads or loved their mom, or loved theirâ€¦wives who loved 
their husbands. It was a tough time, you know, it was a tough time for 
all of us because we were a very emotional, and I was emotional at 
times. I felt, I felt the same now as I did then, which is sad. And I 
still feel sad for those who grieve for their families, but through my 
tears, I see opportunity.â€The president was supposed to be with the families for about 30 minutes; 
he stayed for two and a half hours. It was there he met Arlene Howard. 
The body of her son, George, was among the first to be found at ground 
zero.â€œI called the police department,â€ Howard remembers, â€œ and they said he 
hadnâ€™t called in for roll call and to call back in an hour and I said, 
â€˜No, I donâ€™t need to call back.â€™ If he hadnâ€™t called in, I knew where he 
was.â€George Howard had rescued children trapped in an elevator back in 1993 
when the World Trade Center was bombed. He had been off duty that day, 
and he was off duty on Sept. 11, but couldnâ€™t stay away. The police 
department gave his badge to his mother and she gave it to the president.â€œHe (the president) he leaned over to talk to me,â€ Howard recalls. â€œAnd 
he extends his sympathy to me and thatâ€™s when I asked him Iâ€™d like to 
present Georgeâ€™s shield to him in honor of all the men and women who 
were killed over there.â€By the end of that day, Mr. Bush flew to Camp David visibly drained.â€œHe was physically exhausted, he was mentally exhausted, he was 
emotionally exhausted, he was spiritually exhausted,â€ recalls Card..The next day â€“ Saturday, Sept. 15 - Mr. Bush met members of his war 
cabinet at the presidential retreat for a last decisive meeting.â€œMy message is for everybody who wears the uniform â€“ get ready. The 
United States will do what it takes,â€ Mr. Bush told them.As Powell remembers it, â€œHe was encouraging us to think boldly. He was 
listening to all ideas; he was not constrained to any one idea; he 
wanted to hear his advisors talk and argue and debate with each other.â€President Bush was pleased with the progress that had been made. â€œOn the 
other hand,â€ he says, â€œI wanted to clarify plans and I went around the 
room and I asked everybody what they thought ought to happen.â€When he left that meeting on Saturday night, he still had not told the 
cabinet what he was planning.â€œI wanted to just think it through,â€ Mr. Bush remembers. â€œAny time you 
commit troops to harmâ€™s way, a president must make sure that he fully 
understands all the consequences and ramifications. And I wanted to just 
spend some time on it alone. And did.â€What were his reservations?Mr. Bush says, â€œCould we win? I didnâ€™t want to be putting our troops in 
there unless I was certain we could win. And I was certain we could win.â€Nine days after the attacks on America, before a joint session of 
Congress the president committed the nation to the war on terror.â€œEach of us will remember what happened that day and to whom it 
happened,â€ Mr. Bush told the Congress and the nation. â€œWeâ€™ll remember 
the moment the news came, where we were and what we were doing. Some 
will remember an image of a fire or a story of rescue. Some will carry 
memories of a face and a voice gone forever. And I will carry this. It 
is the police shield of a man named George Howard, who died at the World 
Trade Center trying to save others. It was given to me by his mom, 
Arlene, as a proud memorial to her son. It is my reminder of lives that 
ended and a task that does not end.â€A year has passed since then, but the president says his job is still to 
remind Americans of what happened and of the war that is still being 
waged, a war he reminds himself of every day in the Oval Office, 
literally keeping score, one terrorist at a time.In his desk, the president says, â€œI have a classified document that 
might have some pictures on there, just to keep reminding me about whoâ€™s 
out there, where they might beâ€And as the terrorists are captures or killed? â€œI might make a little 
check there, yeah,â€ Mr. Bush admits.But there is no check by the name that must be on the top of that list â€“ 
Osama bin Laden.(CBS)Â A lot has happened in the year since Sept. 11. One year ago, the 
president was new on the job, with little experience in foreign policy. 
He had wanted to pull the military back from foreign entanglements. Now, 
on his orders, U.S. forces are engaged around the globe in a war he did 
not expect, in a world completely changed. In the Oval Office last week, 
CBS News Correspondent Scott Pelley asked the president about Iraq, 
about whether Americans are safe at home and about Osama bin Laden.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Scott Pelley: You must be frustrated, maybe angry. After a year, we 
still donâ€™t have Osama Bin Laden?President Bush: How do you know that? I donâ€™t know whether Osama bin 
Laden is dead or alive. I donâ€™t know that. Heâ€™s not leading a lot of 
parades. And heâ€™s not nearly the hero that a lot of people thought he 
was. This is much bigger than one person anyway. This is â€” weâ€™re slowly 
but surely dismantling and disrupting the al Qaeda network that, that 
hates America. And we will stay on task until we complete the task. I 
always knew this was a different kind of war, Scott. See, in the old 
days, you measure the size and the strength of the enemy by counting his 
tanks or his airplanes and his ships. This is an international manhunt. 
Weâ€™re after these people one at the time. Theyâ€™re killers. Period.Pelley: But have you won the war before you find Osama bin Laden dead or 
alive?Mr. Bush: If he were dead, thereâ€™s somebody else to replace him. And we 
would find that person. But slowly but surely, we will dismantle the al 
Qaeda network. And those who sponsor them and those who harbor them. And 
at the same time, hopefully lay the seeds for, the conditions necessary 
so that people donâ€™t feel like theyâ€™ve got to conduct terror to achieve 
objectives.Pelley: Do you look back on the Afghan campaign with any doubts? 
Certainly, weâ€™ve overthrown the Taliban government. Certainly, al Qaeda 
has been scattered. But some of the Taliban leaders appear to have 
gotten away. And there have been many civilian casualties as well.Mr. Bush: Uh huh. Well, you know, I am sad that civilians lost their 
life. But I understand war. We did everything we can to â€” everything we 
could to protect people. When civilians did die, it was because of a 
mistake. Certainly not because of intention. We liberated a country for 
which Iâ€™m extremely proud. No, â€” I donâ€™t second guess things. Itâ€™s â€” 
things never go perfect in a time of war.Pelley: Are you committed to ending the rule of Saddam Hussein?Mr. Bush: Iâ€™m committed to regime change.Pelley: There are those who have been vocal in their advice against war 
in Iraq. Some of our allies in the Gulf War, Saudi Arabia, Turkey for 
example. Even your fatherâ€™s former national security advisor, Mr. 
Scowcroft has written about it in the paper. What is it in your 
estimation that they donâ€™t understand about the Iraq question that you 
do appreciate?Mr. Bush: The policy of the government is regime change, Scott, hasnâ€™t 
changed. I get all kinds of advice. Iâ€™m listening to the advice. I 
appreciate the consultations. And weâ€™ll consult with a lot of people but 
our policy hasnâ€™t changed.Pelley: On Air Force One you described the terrorists as evil.Mr. Bush: Yeah.Pelley: I donâ€™t think anyone would disagree with that, but at the same 
time, many in the Arab world are angry at the United States for 
political reasons because of our policy in Israel or our troops in the 
oil region of the Middle East. Is there any change in foreign policy 
that youâ€™re considering that might reduce Arab anger against the United 
States.Mr. Bush: Hmm. Well, Iâ€™m working for peace in the Middle East. Iâ€™m the 
first president that ever went to the United Nations and publicly 
declared the need to have a Palestinian state living side-by-side with 
Israel in peace. Iâ€™ve made it clear that in order for there to be peace 
the Palestinians have gotta to get some leadership that renounces terror 
and believes in peaces and quits using the Palestinian people as pawns. 
I've also made it clear to the other Arab nations in the region that 
theyâ€™ve got responsibilities. If you want peace they gotta work toward 
it. Weâ€™re more than willing to work for it, but they have to work for it 
as well. But all this business isnâ€™t going to happen as long as a few 
are willing to blow up the hopes of many. So we all gotta work to fight 
off terror.Pelley: Arafat has to go?Mr. Bush: Either, heâ€™s, heâ€™s been a complete failure as far as I am 
concerned. Utter disappointment.Pelley: There has been some concern over the year about civil liberties.Mr. Bush: Yeahâ€¦Pelley: In fact, an appeals court recently was harsh about your 
administrationâ€™s decision to close certain deportation hearings. They 
said, quote, â€œA government operating in secrecy stands in opposition to 
the Constitution.â€ Where do you draw the line sir?Mr. Bush: I draw the line at the Constitution. We will protect America. 
But we will do so on, within the guidelines of the Constitution, 
confines of the Constitution, spirit of the Constitution.Pelley: Is there anything that the Justice Department has brought to you 
as an idea that youâ€™ve thought, â€œNo, thatâ€™s too far. I donâ€™t wanna goâ€¦""Mr. Bush: Nah, not that that I remember. And I am pleased with the 
Justice Department. I think that Attorney Generalâ€™s doing a fine job, by 
the way...and to the extent that our courts are willing to make sure 
that they review decisions we make, I think thatâ€™s fine. I mean, thatâ€™s 
good. Itâ€™s healthy. Itâ€™s part of America.Pelley: Franklin Roosevelt said that America should stand in defense of 
four freedoms. Freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom from want 
and freedom from fear. Do we have that today Mr. President? Freedom from 
fear?Mr. Bush: I think more than we did, in retrospect. The fact that we are 
on alert, the fact that we understand the new circumstances makes us 
more free from fear than on that fateful day of September the 11th. 
Weâ€™ve got more work to do.Pelley: And Americans should not live their lives in fear?Mr. Bush: I donâ€™t think so. No. I think Americans oughta know their 
governmentâ€™s doing everything possible to help. And obviously if we get 
information that relates directly a particular attack weâ€™ll deal with 
it. And if we get noise that deals with a general attack, weâ€™ll alert 
people. There are a lot of good folks working hard to disrupt and deny 
and run down leads. And the American people need to go about their 
lives. It seems like they are.

Date: Not suppliedGreat article on a group of East Bay activists who rehab junk computers, using 
semi-skilled volunteers who train other semi-skilled volunteers. The resulting 
computers are sent to the developing world for activist use.     For the Amazonian villages where there's no electricity or where phone 
    lines are scarce, the activists plan to set up free computer labs in the 
    nearby cities. Many cities already have commercial Internet cafes, but they 
    cost about a dollar per hour of use, Henshaw-Plath says, which is about a 
    day's wage for most of the population.     The IMC activists plan to ship off these computers to Guayaquil, Ecuador's 
    main port city, by the end of September. Because none of the computers are 
    being sold in Ecuador, and because they're being transferred from an 
    American nonprofit to an Ecuadorian one, the activists won't be charged any 
    international shipping duties on the computers. ""It's what you call real 
    free trade,"" says Eddie Nix.  Link[1] Discuss[2] (_Thanks, Markoffcharney!_)[1] http://www.salon.com/tech/feature/2002/09/23/antiglobal_geeks/index.html

"Once upon a time, Ralf wrote :> Are there any reasons _not_ to use the new apt releases on RH 7.x?Hmmm... I don't see any :-)My main concern is that when rebuilding the recent packages I've made for
Psyche on Valhalla, I'd need to lower the ""Release:"" tag (to keep an
upgrade working), and that would f*ck up my CVS repository which is on my
Valhalla box (well, I'm exagerating, It'll just make it more difficult for
me) ;-)
Sure, there are easy ways around this, but the easiest for me will be to
wait until I upgrade my main box to Psyche and have Valhalla only on a
secondary rebuild system.Matthias--

i want to make sure that i keep you all in the loop so everyone has a pretty good sense of what ' s going on . first of all , i want to thank a number of you for some very nice voice mails or emails . they ' ve been very supportive and i thank you for that . i do intend to get back to everybody personally - - i ' ve just been busy and jammed up this week , but i do want you to know i really appreciate it . it ' s been a little hectic this week , so i do apologize for the delay in getting back to you . anyway , a couple of things have happened this week and i just want to make sure everybody understands what they are . number one is the result of the special investigative report . we ' re beginning to reshape the senior management team and as a result rick buy and rick causey ' s employment with the company has been terminated . to the extent that there are any additional changes , obviously i ' ll keep you up to speed . we ' re also in the process of shrinking and reconstituting the board . six directors resigned earlier this week and their resignation is effective in 30 days . we ' re initiating a fairly aggressive search for some new directors , which will continue to replace some existing directors and at the end of the day the board will be reconstituted . at the board meeting this week , i reiterated that it ' s my intent in working with all of you to present some restructuring proposals to the creditor ' s committee by the second quarter , and nothing that i see today leads me conclude that we can ' t make that schedule . i continue to believe that there is a very nice re - organizable platform here , so that the company can move forward . there was some bad news with respect to enron stock . as far as i can tell , the claims base here - that is bank debt , bond holder debt and other unsecured creditors debt - is going to overwhelm the reorganized value of whatever platform that we move forward . as a result , it ' s not probable that there will any residual value for existing shareholders . that ' s not good news . it ' s an unfortunate result of this problem , and i wish it was different . but i don ' t want you to be misled and i don ' t want any of you to believe that there is value there , because i don ' t think there will be . in particular i don ' t want you to continue to invest your earnings in enron stock without being aware of , at least in my view , shareholder value at the end of the day . the media sometimes interprets the elimination of existing shareholder value as a sign that this is going to be a liquidation . i don ' t believe that will be the case here . i think we have a tough road to hoe . i think that it is going to require us to rebuild credibility in this company and its management team . none the less , i do believe that we are going to have a reorganization here , and i ' m absolutely committed and dedicated to making that happen . a couple of other things that i want you to be aware of : as soon as the dust settles around the reformation of the management team , we will get out a memo as to who the new management team will be and what their roles , responsibilities are . we are continuing to shape and push forward with the creditors committee a retention and severance program , which i know is important to all of you . as that gets cemented , i will provide you with additional updates . and another thing , i ' ve asked a number of our colleagues to plan in early to mid - march , an employee meeting at one of these local hotels . it will , more likely than not , be in the evening and it can go as late as you want it to go . what i thought we would do is give everybody , in a plain vanilla way , a short presentation as to where we are going and how we intend to get there . then we will have a giant question and answer session , so that if any of you have concerns , issues , problems , or upsets , we can get it all out on the table and figure out collectively the best way to deal with these things . that ' s where we stand as of valentine ' s day . once again , i would like to thank all of those of you who have given me some real nice emails and voicemails for your support . again , i apologize that i haven ' t been able to get back to you as quickly as i would like , but i promise you i will and i hope everybody has a great day . if you have any questions or issues , send me an email , give me a buzz or drop by my office . i would be more than happy to have a chat with you . happy valentine ' s day . thanks again so much and i ' ll give you the next update as soon as practicably possible .",Safe Email

"http://www.guardian.co.uk/religion/Story/0,2763,806744,00.htmlEvangelicals' threat to new archbishopDirect action threat over liberal views on sexualityStephen Bates, religious affairs correspondent
Tuesday October 8, 2002
The GuardianEvangelical fundamentalists last night stepped up their campaign to oust
Rowan Williams, the incoming Archbishop of Canterbury, before he even takes
up his post, by threatening to take ""direct action"" against him.
The council of the Church Society, the Church of England's oldest
evangelical body, joined a younger evangelical pressure group called Reform,
which is also opposed to Dr Williams, in calling on him to recant his
supposedly liberal views on sexuality or stand down.
Following an emergency meeting, the 167-year-old society, whose leaders met
the archbishop last week, proclaimed their continued opposition to his
appointment and called on all Anglicans to spurn him.
The move is the latest stage of an increasingly aggressive attempt to
destabilise the new archbishop, whose leftwing political views are regarded
with deep suspicion by the conservative fringes of the evangelical movement.
Some evangelicals object to Dr Williams's acknowledgement that he has
ordained a gay priest, something many bishops have done, and that those who
have sex outside marriage need not necessarily be spurned. The new
archbishop has repeatedly assured them that he respects the canons of the
church.
Nevertheless, the society said: ""It is clear that he prefers his private
judgment to the voice of scripture, to the voice of tradition and to the
common mind of the church. As such he can only be a focus of disunity.
""The council... called upon loyal Anglicans to pray specifically that Rowan
Williams would see the error in his teaching, change his views or stand
down,"" it said.
The society claimed to have drawn up an ""action plan,"" including calling on
bishops and primates of the 70 million worldwide Anglican communion, of
which archbishops of Canterbury are the leaders, to distance themselves from
Dr Williams's doctrinal and ethical position. It promised it would be
""taking steps towards appropriate direct action"".
It added that Dr Williams remained on the editorial board of a journal
called Theology and Sexuality which, six months ago, published articles
allegedly commending homosexual behaviour.
Despite its claim, the society does not represent the common mind of the
church. Dr Williams, currently Archbishop of Wales, was chosen by the crown
appointments commission of church members, including evangelicals, and his
appointment was endorsed by the prime minister and the Queen.
He is due to succeed George Carey, who retires this month, and will be
formally enthroned at Canterbury cathedral in February.
Asked what form direct action might take, the Rev George Curry, the
society's chairman, said: ""Watch this space."" Presumably it could involve a
small minority of parishes repudiating the new archbishop and seeking
alternative oversight or even demonstrations at services where Dr Williams
is present.
Church of England bishops, who have hitherto largely kept their heads down
during the row, are meeting next week to discuss their response to the
evangelical extremists' challenge, which appears to have grown in the
absence of a robust rebuttal.
A letter by senior theologians in today's Guardian, however, repudiates the
evangelicals' tactics, calling them unseemly and contrary to biblical
teaching.
On the BBC's Thought for the Day yesterday, Angela Tilby, vice-principal of
Westcott House, Cambridge, accused Dr Williams's opponents of presumption
and blackmail. ""It is in fact a thoroughly aggressive way to behave. It is
attempting to force an issue by emotional violence... manipulating to get
your way is often preferable to painstaking negotiation,"" she said.
Last week, Dr Williams said he was deeply saddened. ""Matters of sexuality
should not have the priority or centrality that Reform and the Church
Society have tried to give them. The archbishop cannot withdraw his
appointment since so many, including evangelicals, have urged him to take
the post... the archbishop believes it to be his duty under God.""

  Oops.
Um, my test was to tee to a fifo I didn't read from... resulting in the other
reader hanging around forever.... not realising that never-opened-for-reading
and opened-and-later-closed might be different.  Sensible behaviour has now been

"update . . . while you were out just wanted to catch you up on the events over the past week . . . . and a couple of things i want to talk to you about next week reporting : it has been a continual challenge as you well know . the good news is the individual from ees ( chris luttrell ) accepted jay ' s offer today and he is going to start on march 3 . that said , i talked to chris today and filled him in on where we are and what we want to accomplish . he feels our best option will be oracle . to ensure we are prepared for his arrival next monday , we are preparing the detail of what we are doing today , both our assumptions and all of the various data sources for our current management reporting also , dave and i met with wanda and georgeanne on tuesday regarding revenue . i believe dave sent you an update of this meeting . we are meeting with georgeanne today to go over our assumptions , conversions , etc . to ensure that we are consistent with those conversations in the annual report , and to ensure that we are capturing all of the enron data customer database - we have been fine tuning this all week , and i think we are about there . there are still some minor differences , but we are working to sort through these today ( everyone is involved in the tie out ) . i will review the new report format with you on monday and we will start sending this out then . we also have an access person that is working on improving our current database since we will have to live with this in the short term . trading activity : it seems that we are seeing an increase in customers wanting to modify eol deals for various reasons ( one being web latency . . . they are claiming that the deal did not show up on their transaction summary , so they thought it did not go through , and they did another deal . . . and this first deal appeared sometime later ) . we have continued to emphasize the importance of not changing these deals after they are completed , but despite this , it is still happening . i am going to try and track down jeff shankman this afternoon to discuss . we are also seeing more and more customers trading under the wrong entities . . . for example , aquila risk mgmt is executing physical deals , when they should be only executing financial deals . from my understanding , we have "" left the door open "" for them to trade either way and are relying on them to trade under the correct counterparty . this is causing several problems downstream . . for instance , customers are wanting ena to send modified invoices with the name of the correct counterparty ( despite the fact that they were the ones transacting under the wrong entity ) . we need to discuss how leaving this door open affects our downstream processes . other : i talked to both dave and bob yesterday to ensure that we were in the loop on new products , etc . to ensure that we are better prepared for the launch of new products ( e . g . credit derivatives ) . help desk news . . . matt m . accepted a position with the remedy development team . we are going to move noel ( he works nights ) to the day shift to take over matt ' s role . donna assures me that he is very good . sandy rivas also wants to leave the group . we should be able to handle the volume of calls without replacing them . i need to go over some call statistics with you next week . we have not received one phone call from a customer on the weekends , and we receive less than . 1 calls per hour between the hours of 7 pm to midnight . i think we can get away with eliminating weekends , and using on call pagers from 7 to midnight . one question - we currently are considering ees an external counterparty and enron canada an internal counterparty . we are now trading with bridgeline gas marketing ( joint venture with texaco - 40 % ownership ) . we need to determine what we are considering internal vs external . i would think these would be external due to the fact that these are settled transactions . . . any thoughts ? i know this is a lot of info , but i also know you are going to be in high demand on monday ! i hope you are enjoying your ski trip ! ! ! sheri",Safe Email

"" enron makes the market . make no mistake about that , "" said merrill lynch analyst donato eassey . "" there ' s not a trader out there that doesn ' t use enrononline . "" as such , enron enters into thousands of transactions every day in which the company ' s credit - worthiness is critical . enron said its business operations were functioning normally yesterday . the company also has consistently said it is financially strong and liquid . enron said its new chief financial officer is jeffrey mcmahon , the 40 - year - old head of the company ' s industrial - markets division . his selection may be intended , in part , to raise the company ' s credibility . people familiar with the matter say mr . mcmahon left his job as treasurer last year after voicing concerns within the company about mr . fastow ' s role in running two limited partnerships that were involved in billions of dollars worth of transactions with enron . internal partnership documents indicate mr . fastow and possibly a handful of associates made millions of dollars from the partnerships . mr . fastow severed his ties with those partnerships in july in the face of increasing conflict - of - interest concerns being expressed by wall street analysts and major enron investors . on monday , enron announced that the securities and exchange commission was looking into the fastow - related transactions . while enron as recently as tuesday strongly defended mr . fastow , as well as the company ' s dealings with the partnerships , controversy over those arrangements clearly played a role in the executive ' s departure . "" in my continued discussions with the financial community , it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace andy as cfo , "" said chairman and chief executive kenneth lay in a prepared statement . enron said mr . fastow "" will be on a leave of absence from the company . "" he couldn ' t be reached for comment . it remains to be seen how much mr . fastow ' s removal will assuage an increasingly restive investment community . the action came after the 4 p . m . market close and followed a day in which enron ' s stock once again plunged . as of 4 p . m . in new york stock exchange composite trading , enron shares were at $ 16 . 41 , down $ 3 . 38 , or 17 % . it topped the big board ' s most active list at nearly 76 million shares , more than twice the volume of the second - most - active stock . several trades yesterday involved blocks of 800 , 000 shares or more , possibly indicating that some institutional holders are souring on enron stock . enron ' s shares are down about 50 % from the beginning of last week . earlier this year , the stock was above $ 80 a share . in an apparent ripple effect , the stocks of other energy - trading companies , which do business with enron , also fell sharply yesterday . for instance , dynegy inc . shares on the big board were off $ 5 . 45 , or 13 % , at $ 37 . 26 . a number of the energy companies hit by the selloff have business strategies much different than enron ' s , which rely heavily on complex and highly structured investment vehicles . prudential securities analyst carol coale said mr . fastow ' s departure could be seen as evidence that "" management does care "" about investor concerns . however , she adds , the move also could be viewed by some investors , coming as it did two days after the announcement of the sec inquiry , as "" an admission of guilt . "" ms . coale yesterday issued a sell recommendation on enron largely because of uncertainties about the company ' s extremely complex financial structure . enron has consistently denied any wrongdoing in its fastow - related dealings . worries and rumors about enron ' s financial strength could be found in the stock market yesterday . goldman sachs analyst david fleischer said he heard people voice concerns about a possible "" death spiral "" in which increasing credit concerns about enron would decrease the number of people willing to do business with the company , which would in turn weaken its finances and lead to further business reductions . mr . fleischer , a longtime fan who still has a buy recommendation on the company , said he hasn ' t yet seen any evidence of such a problem . however , mr . fleischer said , enron needs to disclose more information about its myriad of financial transactions with related partnerships and other entities . enron is facing a problem with "" trust and credibility . it ' s not easy to regain something as basic as trust , "" he said . copyright ? 2000 dow jones section c enron ousts finance chief as s . e . c . looks at dealings by floyd norris 10 / 25 / 2001 the new york times page 2 , column 5 c . 2001 new york times company the enron corporation , its stock battered by a sudden loss of investor confidence , yesterday ousted its chief financial officer , andrew s . fastow , whose involvement in complicated transactions with enron has drawn the scrutiny of the securities and exchange commission . ' ' in my continued discussions with the financial community , it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace andy as c . f . o . , ' ' kenneth l . lay , enron ' s chairman and chief executive , said in a statement announcing the change . only one day before , mr . lay had told investors in a conference call that he and the enron board ' ' continue to have the highest faith and confidence in andy . ' ' the company said that mr . fastow had taken a leave of absence , but it also named his successor , jeffrey mcmahon , the head of enron ' s industrial markets group and a former corporate treasurer . enron said none of the officials were available for interviews last night . the move came after the close of trading on the new york stock exchange , where enron ' s shares fell $ 3 . 38 , to $ 16 . 41 . the price has been cut in half since oct . 16 , when enron reported its third - quarter earnings . a $ 1 . 2 billion reduction in shareholder equity brought on by ending some relationships with partnerships that mr . fastow had headed was not disclosed in the earnings news release . mr . lay briefly mentioned it in the conference call that followed , but some analysts thought he was referring to a separate $ 1 billion write - off that was disclosed in the earnings document , and were angered when they later learned about it . on tuesday , when both mr . fastow and mr . lay discussed the company with analysts on the conference call , neither was willing to discuss details of the transactions between enron and the partnerships formerly controlled by mr . fastow . mr . lay cited the s . e . c . inquiry in declining to discuss the details of the transactions . the fact the transactions took place has been known for a year , but enron ' s disclosures have been widely criticized for being impossible to understand . by structuring the deals as involving forward commitments to deliver enron stock , it appears that enron was able to assure that losses on them would not lead to reported losses , but instead to reductions of shareholder equity that had no effect on the income statement . that is one of the issues the s . e . c . , whose inquiries were disclosed monday by the company , is expected to address . concerns have also grown this week over whether enron will face losses from complicated financing strategies that kept billions of dollars of debts off its balance sheet but left the company responsible for paying - - either in cash or with stock - - if things went wrong . on tuesday , mr . fastow assured investors that the company ' ' expects to continue to have sufficient liquidity to meet normal obligations , ' ' and said it had bank credit lines that were more than adequate . mr . fastow was viewed as one of the architects , with jeffrey k . skilling , the former enron chief executive who resigned in august , of the change in business strategy that turned enron from a gas - pipeline company into a an energy trading powerhouse that developed a large wall street following . its stock price peaked in the summer of 2000 at $ 90 . 75 . according to a person close to the company , while mr . mcmahon , mr . fastow ' s successor , was enron ' s treasurer , he told mr . skilling , who at the time was the chief operating officer , that he thought the partnerships involving mr . fastow presented a conflict of interest . after that discussion , mr . mcmahon moved to a different job at the company , this person said . shares of enron traded as low as $ 15 . 51 yesterday afternoon , the lowest price for the stock since early 1995 , before recovering . in after - hours trading , they fell to $ 16 . 14 . one of the factors that hurt the stock yesterday was a decision by m . carol coale , an analyst at prudential securities , to drop her rating to ' ' sell ' ' from ' ' hold . ' ' she had lowered the rating to ' ' hold ' ' from ' ' buy ' ' on monday . ' ' after the s . e . c . inquiry was announced , ' ' she said in an interview yesterday evening , ' ' enron should have addressed it by delivering a scapegoat , as a gesture to the street . now they are replacing him today . the timing is a little late , but i think it will be received positively by the street .

"" in my continued discussions with the financial community , it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace andy as cfo , "" enron chairman and ceo ken lay said in a statement after the stock market closed on a day investors continued dumping shares . enron , which had seen its stock battered this year for a variety of reasons , found itself high on wall street ' s hit list after it released third - quarter earnings on oct 16 . the earnings report drew renewed attention to something investors and analysts had already expressed displeasure at : fastow , with the approval of enron ' s board , had formed and run two investment partnerships - - ljm cayman and ljm 2 co - investment . the partnerships , which did complex financing and hedging deals with enron , served as a source of funding for enron projects and investments . but wall street questioned how fastow could watch out for the interests of enron ' s shareholders and the investment partnership at the same time . so fastow , in june , resigned his roles at the partnerships and enron also ended its relationships with the ljm entities . during the third - quarter , enron took a $ 35 million loss related to ending its ljm ties as well as a $ 1 . 2 billion reduction in shareholder equity . tuesday , lay told analysts and investors that procedures were rigorously followed to ensure the interests of enron and its shareholders were protected in dealings with the ljm partnerships . he said a "" chinese wall "" existed between enron and ljm . fastow ' s replacement , mcmahon , previously served as enron ' s treasurer before moving last year to another job with enron . most recently , he headed up the company ' s industrial markets group . a source close to enron said mcmahon asked to be reassigned from the treasurer ' s job because he was uncomfortable with the fastow - ljm setup . enron spokesman mark palmer said neither fastow nor mcmahon was available for comment wednesday . he also didn ' t know whether fastow is still receiving a salary . enron disclosed on monday that federal securities regulators had begun an "" informal inquiry "" into the ljm dealings . the news proved terrible for a company already working to rebuild investor confidence after a series of failed investments in telecommunications , water and retail power businesses and the surprise resignation of ceo jeff skilling in august for personal reasons . a continuously growing number of shareholder lawsuits against enron followed the earnings report and the news of the sec inquiry . wall street has stepped up its chronic complaints that enron ' s various financial dealings are too complex to follow and that the company fails to give analysts enough data to make proper evaluations . beyond the ljm partnerships , investors are concerned about two other partnerships enron set up . among the worries is that enron will end up having to issue new shares of stock to cover commitments associated with those entities . investors wouldn ' t like that because it would dilute the value of current outstanding shares . they are also afraid that enron ' s debt credit rating may be downgraded , which could have negative impacts on its overall business . in the last six days , enron ' s shares have closed lower and lower . on oct . 16 , the stock closed at $ 33 . 84 . on wednesday it closed at $ 16 . 41 , down $ 3 . 38 . wednesday , the hubbub surrounding enron also dragged down shares in other companies that engage in energy trading , including houston - based dynegy , which closed down $ 5 . 45 at $ 37 . 26 . there is concern enron ' s woes could in some way end up harming the energy trading markets . a conference call lay and senior executives , including fastow , held with analysts tuesday to help clear up questions didn ' t go as enron hoped . on wednesday , carol coale , an analyst with prudential securities in houston , moved from a "" hold "" to a "" sell "" rating . front page -

first section - enron replaces finance chief - energy company attempts to halt sharp decline in its share price . enron , the us energy group , yesterday replaced its embattled chief financial officer , andrew fastow , to try to halt a slide in its share price , which has lost about 40 per cent of its value this week . kenneth lay , enron ' s chief executive officer , said after the market closed that mr fastow was taking a leave of absence . the move came a day after mr lay defended mr fastow amid questions about his ties to controversial partnerships that had forced enron to take a $ 1 . 2 bn write - off . that loss , revealed last week , sparked the share sell - off amid concerns there may be more bad news to come . enron disclosed the loss during an october 16 conference call with analysts on its third - quarter results , saying the charge stemmed from closing funding mechanisms that enron had set up in the partnerships established with mr fastow . analysts say the charge has not been satisfactorily explained , leading to confusion among investors and an unofficial inquiry by the securities and exchange commission . "" in my continued discussions with the financial community , it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace andy as cfo , "" mr lay said . he said jeff mcmahon , chairman and chief executive of enron ' s industrial markets group , would replace mr fastow . mr mcmahon earlier served as enron ' s treasurer . analysts said it was unclear whether mr fastow ' s departure would be enough . carol coale , of prudential securities , said the move was positive in demonstrating that enron was being sensitive to wall street , which had called for mr fastow to be replaced . yet , she added , it came three days after those calls . ms coale issued a "" sell "" recommendation on enron earlier yesterday , leading to a drop of almost 18 per cent in its share price .

' ' on a recent conference call ` ` no one thought they did themselves any favor in terms of calming investors ' concerns . ' ' ` ` they were slightly hiding behind the fact that the sec has got this inquiry going . the fact that two days later andy is gone , and he was in the center , is a good sign that the company is realizing just how concerned investors are . ' ' ` ` there ' s always that worry once the sec gets involved that it could extend . you never know what could come of that . ' ' ` ` there is a bit of fear of the unknown about enron now , with the sec inquiry and the risk that there could be further asset write - downs . ' ' ` ` another thing they ' re criticized for is their lack of disclosure . we still haven ' t seen a balance sheet for the third quarter . ' ' ` ` people are saying , why don ' t you include a balance sheet with your results ? they promised better disclosure in the past and that was meant to begin in the third quarter . ' ' ` ` you ' d like to see just more information on asset write - downs and a discussion of their off - balance - sheet financing - - all these vehicles they have like marlin and osprey . ' ' ` ` we ' d like to see some clarity , answering those sort of questions . ' ' ` ` it seems as though enron at least are maybe at the start of a process where they ' re going to address and clean up their balance sheet and they ' ve started to replace management . ' ' ` ` investors have already had enough issues ' ' in corporate bonds recently and ` ` sometimes investors just think , ` not another nasty in my portfolio , ' and i ' d rather exit . ' ' ` ` for certain investors maybe they just get scared . i wanted to know more about it . people had speculated if it could go to junk . i don ' t think they could because i don ' t think enron could exist as a junk company . ' ' ` ` there ' s a certain reluctance ' ' to sell the bonds . ` ` you want to stand back for a moment and look at the fundamentals . ' ' ` ` when the spreads have already moved out that wide you have to reassess and see whether you think it ' s a buying opportunity .

"" a . g . edwards & sons analyst mike heim , however , said it will take more than replacing fastow as chief financial officer to clear the uncertainty looming in the financial world about enron and its partnerships . "" i think the reason why the stock has been declining so sharply the last few days is due to a lack of clarity on the partnership arrangements , "" heim said . replacing fastow alone won ' t clarify those arrangements , he added . "" there is still uncertainty despite promises by management to be more transparent to the financial community , "" heim said . "" instead of being more transparent there is more confusion than ever .

"" i didn ' t hear things like we ' ve unrolled all these partnership dealings or here ' s all the exact details of how the partnerships work or we don ' t ever expect to take any more charges , "" heim said . "" what i heard is we don ' t have to disclose that information until the 10 - q is filed .

"" it ' s really a speculative bet right now , but the odds favor the company being able to weather the storm and being a healthy company if not a year from now , two years from now , "" he said . but much is going to depend on how much enron discloses to its investors , feygin said . feygin said mcmahon worked as enron ' s treasurer for two years under fastow before a disagreement over fastow ' s involvement in the partnerships caused mcmahon to leave his job as treasurer . "" internally , jeff was always a proponent of andy not being involved in ( the partnerships ) , "" feygin said .

2000 dow jones a press release says fastow is taking a leave of absence . he ' s been replaced by jeffrey mcmahon , formerly ceo of enron ' s industrial markets group . how might the enron bulls spin this ? likely , they will point to mcmahon ' s alleged opposition to fastow ' s role in the big hedging deal , called ljm 2 , to show that the "" fastow era "" is over . the wall street journal , citing anonymous sources , reported tuesday that as treasurer at enron mcmahon complained about fastow ' s possible conflict of interest . probably , the fear was that fastow couldn ' t serve enron and ljm 2 equally , especially as he was allegedly making a lot of money from ljm 2 . clearly , if mcmahon turns out to be a new broom , that ' s a positive for enron . an enron spokeswoman declined to comment on whether the journal ' s account of mcmahon ' s stance on ljm 2 was correct . not much else is encouraging , however . fastow ' s departure shows that it took massive drops in enron stock to force senior management into action . on a difficult conference call tuesday , ceo ken lay gave fastow resounding backing . it took wednesday ' s plunge to get lay to sign off on a new cfo . in other words , lay listens only when the market screams and hollers . how much further does the stock have to fall to bring further much - needed reforms at the company ? the spokeswoman responds that lay had discussions with analysts tuesday and wednesday that led him to the conclusion that fastow ' s replacement was necessary to rebuild investor confidence . enron culture is thick with financial sorcery . people got upset by one shadowy deal , but no one knows exactly how the company ' s core energy trading business makes money . it ' s hard to believe the ljm 2 deals were done in isolation and without the knowledge of the board . in fact , the chatter is that fastow and former ceo jeff skilling proposed the ljm 2 transactions to the board after it was reluctant to enter the broadband business . the board apparently feared the volatility that might come from being in broadband , so fastow allegedly proposed ljm 2 as a way to hedge that volatility away . this meant ljm 2 entered agreements that gave it access to increases in the value of broadband assets but protected enron from the downside . should the whole board be on the hook , too ? the spokeswoman responds that the board would not have entered the ljm 2 transaction if it had not thought it would benefit enron and its shareholders . lay has shown himself to be woefully out of touch with the market ' s views . arguably , that ' s downright reckless for a trading company that is dependent on potentially skittish short - term financing . letting things get this bad has risked good faith among enron counterparties and bankers . it shows an unhealthy reluctance to address key problems until they ' re unavoidable . the spokeswoman responds that the company is now working hard to improve transparency . any efforts in that direction will be much appreciated , but is it any wonder people compare this lot to long term capital management ?

"summary of names of days dear linguists , in the december 15 issue of linguist i posted a request for examples of deictic expressions for the names of days either side of "" today "" . here is the summary of what i obtained . the response was overwhelming - a total of 70 linguist subscribers sent replies . many , many thanks to all of you who contributed . quite a number of respondents supplied information on two or more languages . there was some duplication of languages , namely japanese , mandarin chinese , danish , french , german , russian and hindi . i now have examples of 48 languages , they are : anejom ( vanuatu ) , a = fee a = fee ( solomon is ) , azerbaijani turkish , basque , bauan ( standard fijian ) , brazilian portuguese , bulgarian , czech , danish , dutch , english , erromagan ( vanuatu ) , estonian , finnish , french , german , hausa , hawai ` ian , hindustani , ipili ( png ) , italian , japanese , kamhmu ? ( vietnam ) , ki - swahili , kope ( png ) , korean , lao / phasa iisaan , lenakel ( vanuatu ) , madarin chinese , malay , mauritian / seychelles creole , modern greek , modern hebrew , norwegian , polish , quechua , rumanian , russian , samoan , serbo - croatian , slovene , sulka ( png ) , swedish , taiwanese , thai , welsh . my original interest in collecting such deictic expressions stems from a general interest in symmetry in language and language systems . most languages exhibit a symmetry in the number of deictic expressions for diurnal units either side of "" today "" , however , some exhibit an asymmetry . c . s . levinson ( pragmatics , 1983 : 75 ) reports , "" the amerindian language chinantec has four named days either side of today ; japanese has three days back from today , and two ahead ; hindi has the same word for yesterday and tomorrow . "" ( levinson gleaned this information from : fillmore , c . j . ( 1975 ) . santa cruz lectures on deixis , 1971 . mimeo , indiana university linguistics club . ) i have not personally been able to get a hold of this the fillmore reference - living in the academically isolated south seas does have some drawbacks ! if any of you have a copy of this publication , i would be very interested in obtaining photocopies of the section on ` time deixis ' . of course , i will reimburse you for the cost of postage and photocopying . anyway , a symmetrical deictic system of diurnal units / spans seems to me logical , though i ' m not sure i can verbalise the reasons . the reported asymmetry in the japanese system seemed to me a bit odd . especially that the asymmetry was lop-sided towards the past ( see below for reasons ) . upon further examination , i discovered that the japanese deictic system for diurnal units does seem to be symmetrical ; it has + 3 and - 3 either side of the present diurnal span . the expression ` siasatte / yanoasatte ' meaning + 3 days from "" today "" is not known to quite an number of native speakers of japanese . they appear to be used infrequently and ` yanoasatte and yaneasatte ' are considered to be dialectal ( at least in relation to the tokyo dialect ) . indeed , the lecturer in japanese in my department ( herself a native speaker of japanese ) was not aware of these expressions until she looked them up in her dictionary . another interesting consideration in all of this is the question as to the number of diurnal units before and after today that languages recognise . what is the maximum / minimum number of units ? also , what is the average number of units ( or most popular system ) ? answers to these questions ( based on my small sample ) below . one respondent asked the following very interesting question : "" if you reach the level of , let 's say , 5 ( days after present diurnal span ) , does this also have the non-specific reading ` at some point in the not-to - far-away future ' in those languages ? "" the only language in my small corpus that has + 5 and - 5 diurnal units in its system is erromangan ( vanuatu ) . i will have to ask my source for erromangan to answer this question . there is an inherent problem in determining the number expressions for diurnal units . this is determining whether the expressions are lexemes or phrases . many languages seem to have "" lexicalised "" ( for want of a better term ) prepositional / nominal phrases . other languages , like for example the english expression ` the day before yesterday ' , have retained the phrase structure . one respondent supplied me with a lengthy discussion on the lexeme / phrase issue . she cites the case of bulgarian ( i hope she won't mind my including her discussion here ) : [ begin quote ] bulgarian presents an [ interesting ] situation with regard to the phrase / lexeme issue because it does n't have a real nominal case paradigm : onzi den - 2 ( lit . "" that / yonder day "" ) vchera - 1 dnes 0 present diurnal span utre + 1 vdrugi den + 2 ( lit . "" other day "" ) so the same form ' pozavchera ' in bulgarian ( with stress on the penultimate syllable ; russian ' pozavchera ' has stress on the final syllable ) perhaps does n't look as strange because one would n't expect ' po ' to require any particular case ending . however , again we have what looks like a preposition with an adverb , which should not exist as a phrase . bulgarian "" tomorrow "" is ' utre ' . but "" the day after tomorrow "" is ' vdrugiden ' - - i . e . , the phrase ' v drugi den ' ( lit . "" on ( the ) other day "" , written without spaces in between the individual words . should this be considered a word simply on orthographic grounds , though ? is it a prepositional phrase or an adverb ? of course the boundary between prepositional phrases and adverbs is very fuzzy to begin with . bulgarian "" the day before yesterday "" , in contrast , is what looks like a noun phrase : ' onja den ' - - "" that day "" . no preposition ' v ' ( "" on "" ) here . so should this be considered just an np or a prepositional phrase ? ' onja den ' is used the same way as ' vdrugiden ' - - ' vidjax go onja den ' - - "" i saw him [ on ] the day before yesterday "" . it seems to me that what 's written as a noun phrase here is really an adverb , like ' vdrugiden ' or like russian ' pozavchera ' and ' poslezavtra ' , the only difference being that the other three adverbs are formed from prepositional phrases while ' onja den ' has no preposition . it would sound strange to call it a prepositional phrase , because , unlike ' vdrugiden ' , it contains no preposition . so i would call it an adverbial phrase . ( time expressions in slavic languages are commonly in the accusative , and that may be the origin of ' onja den ' , but since modern bulgarian has lost its nominal case paradigm for the most part this makes it harder to determine the status of phrases like this one . ( cf . russian ' kazhduju nedelju ' ( "" each - acc week - acc "" ) , which means "" every week "" in an adverbial sense . ) bulgarian does n't have specific words for "" the day before the day before yesterday "" - - that would be , i think , ' v denja predi onja den ' ( "" on the day before the day before yesterday "" ) , but of course speakers would avoid that and just would say ' predi dva dena ' ( "" two days ago "" , lit . "" before two days "" ) . the same would be true for ' vdrugiden ' - - ' v denja sled vdrugiden ' is conceivably possible ( "" on the day after the-day - after-tomorrow "" ) , but speakers would say 's led dva dena ' ( "" in / after two days "" ) . so i think it may be very difficult here to draw a demarcation line here between the grammatical categories of words vs . phrases . [ end of quote ] quite a number of languages ( especially slavonic and germanic languages ) allow recursion of prepositions / prefixes to "" add on "" to the already existing deictic expressions . the extent to which this recursion can be practiced is limited only by pragmatic constraints . here are some nice examples : rumanian : ras-ras - ras-alaltaieri ( ? ) - 5 ras-ras - alaltaieri ( ? ) - 4 ras-alaltaieri - 3 alaltaieri - 2 ieri - 1 azi / astazi 0 present diurnal span miine + 1 poimiine + 2 ras-poimiine + 3 ras-ras - poimiine ( ? ) + 4 ras-ras - ras-poimiine ( ? ) + 5 etc . dutch : ( eer-eergisteren ) + 3 eergisteren + 2 gisteren - 1 vandaag 0 present diurnal span morgen + 1 overmorgen + 2 ( over-overmorgen ) + 3 danish : ( i for-forgars - 3 ) i forgars - 2 i gar - 1 i dag 0 present diurnal span i morgen + 1 i overmorgen + 2 ( i over-overmorgen + 3 the - 3 and + 3 forms are rather colloquial , but nevertheless perfectly idiomatic . further recursions of prefixes / prepositions are only used in jocular ways , and predominantly by children . finally , if you have read this far , you are about to be rewarded with a summary of the data i have at this point . number of diurnal units either side of "" today "" : symmetrical deictic systems - 1 0 + 1 no examples - 2 - 1 0 + 1 + 2 23 examples - 3 - 2 - 1 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 14 examples - 4 - 3 - 2 - 1 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 3 examples - 5 - 4 - 3 - 2 - 1 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 1 example - erromangan ( vanuatu ) asymmetrical deictic systems - 2 - 1 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 3 examples - 2 - 1 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 1 example - malay - 2 - 1 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 1 example - hausa - 3 - 2 - 1 0 + 1 + 2 1 example - colloquial spanish ( southern spain ) it 's interesting to note that no language in the sample employs the - 1 0 + 1 system . and the majority of asymmetrical systems are lop-sided towards the + side of the present diurnal span . why this should be so , i do n't know . however , this sample is very small and perhaps a larger sample would show no such lop-sidedness towards the + "" today "" side . are the languages that show a lop-sidedness in a state of change ? most languages have a symmetrical vowel system e . g . the same number of front vowels as back vowels . however , there are quite a number of languages with asymmetrical vowel systems . what lies behind this asymmetry ? the answer to this question may lie in the following scenario [ from : crowley , t . ( 1992 ) an introduction to historical linguistics , oup , pp . 200-201 ] suppose that in a language with a nice symmetrical five vowel system : i u e o a the vowel / e / beocomes raised towards / i / and ultimately merges merges with / i / . the resulting asymmetrical system : i u o a will put structural pressure on the system , and , in time , it would not be surprising to see / o / merging with / u / . if a system becomes asymmetrical ( or uneven ) so as to create some sort of ` gap ' , then a change is likely to take place as a way of plugging that ` gap ' , thereby re-establishing an even ( or symmetrical ) system . if this is indeed a natural process in phonological systems , perhaps analogous processes occur in other systems , like temporal deictic systems . a language with an asymmetrical temporal deictic system may be in the process of historical change and the ` gap ' plugged in due time . japanese may be a language that is in the process of losing its + 3 deictic term . if this is indeed the case , it would be interesting to see whether , in due course , this "" imbalance "" is "" balanced "" again by the loss of its - 3 deictic term . i do n't know how valid any of this is , i ' m just speculating . anyway , back to symmetry . the most symmetrical system of all is that found in hindi : tarso - 4 narso - 3 parso - 2 kal - 1 aaj 0 present diurnal span kal ( bihaan ) + 1 parso + 2 narso + 3 tarso + 4 where there are not only an equal number expressions for diurnal units either side of "" today "" , but the expressions on either side are the same . distinction between "" before today "" and "" after today "" is made through use of past or future tense of the verb . in looking at a language 's temporal deictic system i guess we must not fail to take account of a number of important linguistic / cultural aspects . among these would be : * the culture 's view of time . is it a linear view or a cyclical view ? * the language 's tense / aspect systems . * the historical development of its deictic expressions in short , we can't study deictics in isolation . we must look at how it meshes grammatically with the language . i would be very interested in any of your views on the reasons for symmetry and asymmetry we find in this area of deixis . also , if you are interested in adding to my list of languages , i 'd be very grateful to receive your contribution . thanks again to all those generous people who sent me so much interesting data and opinions . yours today , tomorrow and . . . jan tent department of literature and language school of humanities the university of the south pacific p . o . box 1168 suva fiji tel : ( 679 ) 313900 ext . 2263 fax : ( 679 ) 305053 e - mail : tent _ j @ usp . ac . fj = 09",Safe Email

Remember when I said that taking an afternoon off to march for Dmitri
was pissing in the wind and that to be really effective we needed
people willing to publically break the stupid laws right in the
face of the authorities?Well it seems Bruce Perens agrees with me, only he's going one better,
instead of just mouthing off about it, he's going to do it and do it 
in a big way ...
    Open source campaigner to risk jail
    By James Middleton [24-07-2002]    Bruce Perens plans live DVD hack    With the dust from the Elcomsoft/Sklyarov case still thick in the
    air, influential open source activist Bruce Perens plans to go one
    better by breaking the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DCMA)
    during a live presentation on Friday.    Fresh from giving RealNetworks a slating for not completely
    backing open source with its latest announcement, Perens said that
    during a Digital Rights Management presentation to be held Friday
    at the O'Reilly developer conference in San Diego, he would break
    the law.    The DMCA has been a sore point in the open source community since
    the outlawing of DeCSS, a tool created so that DVDs could be
    played on Linux machines, and more recently since the arrest of
    Dmitry Sklyarov and the criminal charges faced by his employer,
    Elcomsoft.    Based on the recent history of DMCA contravention, Perens could
    face imprisonment or a $500,000 fine for his actions.    According to Infoworld the demonstration is to be carried out in
    protest at the regional system used by the motion picture industry
    to prevent DVDs released in one country being played on machines
    in another country.    During his presentation, Perens will demonstrate how to hack a DVD
    player so that it can play movies from any region.    ""It is a political and social statement, and the statement is that
    the people do not need to have a hall monitor living in their
    stereo system and should be able to play any kind of media on the
    device they wish,"" he was quoted as saying.    But luck may be on his side, if last year is anything to go by. At
    the same conference in 2001 Perens made a presentation on the
    triviality of Digital Rights Management systems using exactly the
    same slides that got Sklyarov arrested.http://www.vnunet.com/News/1133862--

"ipa vs americanist symbols i am at last drawn to reply to the debate on ipa versus ' americanist ' traditions in phonetic transcription . i was , frankly , somewhat surprised by the tone of the original submission , suggesting that the ipa 's refusal to use hachek / wedge symbols for palatoalveolars was an example of racism ( both anti - americanism and anti-slavicism , and no doubt anti - diacriticism ) . now we learn that the ipa itself is an anti-democratic conspiracy , and we need a new campaign led by american organisations to make phonetic transcription 's afe for democracy , apple pie , and the american way ' ! ? a couple of points need to made in this regard , i think . first , it is not true that the ipa is not used in north america . what we have here is maybe not euro - centrism , but phonology / dialectology centrism ! clinical phoneticians and speech pathologists in north american nearly always use the ipa ( yes : long esses / zees , jods , and the cardinal vowel system , and all ! ) indeed , some departments of linguistics / phonetics operate within the ipa tradition ( e . g . university of victoria bc ) . on the other hand , virtually all phonologists on this side of the atlantic use the so-called americanist symbols . the divide , therefore , is not as has been portrayed . if phonologists tend to use one set of symbols , and phoneticians another , is that really such a problem , as often they are concerned with different levels of description anyway ? even if phoneticians cannot agree , is this also such a problem ? can raising the fears of racial discrimination and undemocratic conspiracies really be justified over relatively trivial distinctions in symbols that anyone trained in the area knows about anyway ? the second point concerns the debate on the symbols themselves . as i have just noted , the difference between certain symbols is surely not a fundamentally important one ; but i would like to speak in defence of the ipa non-hachek versions . leaving aside the fact that these symbols do have a long history , i ( do ) feel that a unit symbol is preferably than a composite one . ( unlike the original posting , it always seemed obvious to me that the hachek symbols were s / z etc plus a diacritic ) . granted that the ipa is not always consistent on this point , a unitary symbol approach avoids confusions as to the nature of the s - s distinction . one may have to counter students ' feelings that [ s ] is really only a type of [ s ] which is reinforced by the spelling ; it does n't help if the symbol looks also like a 's ort of s ' . we might also look at the difference with [ j ] versus [ y ] for the palatal approximant . on the surface , this looks fine , as the [ y ] spelling is familiar ( but surely anglocentric , and not in line with slavic / germanic etc usage ? ) . however , this choice then leaves us with a problem for a high front rounded vowel . if we can't use [ y ] then we must resort to [ u "" ] . the diacritic [ "" ] , however , is also commonly used in many traditions to stand for centralized . this transcription also suggests that [ u "" ] is a variety of [ u ] , and that [ o "" ] is a variety of [ o ] etc . the use of independent symbols leaves open the relationship between lip-rounding and tongue position , which the 'd iaresis ' versions do not . however phonetic transcription develops in the future , let 's avoid throwing around accusations at other users or bodies . utopian schemes of universal orthodoxy in this area are surely unneccessary if not unsound . to be realistic , most ipa users ( wherever they ' re based ) are unlikely to surrender over a century 's worth of patterns of usage , and non - ipa users will be equally keen to keep to their symbolizations . let 's learn to live with this , and spend instead time on refining transcription systems ( e . g . for the transcription of atypical speech found in speech pathology clinics ) . perhaps , vive la difference is the motto to aspire to ! martin j . ball university of ulster",Safe Email
"I've never understood the mouse buffer operation with exmh either. Here's the 
behaviour I have. I have exmh and XEmacs windows up, and a terminal window. (I 
also have gnome1.4 running and enlightenment as wm.) I select text in the exmh 
window and while it is highlighted, I can paste into anything else. If I select 
it and then click so the highlighting is off, then what I paste is not the 
recently-selected text in exmh, but an old selection. If I select in XEmacs and 
leave it highlighted, I can paste it into exmh sedit window; but if it is no 
longer highlighted, what I paste is an old selection. I can live with this 
behaviour except for one additional thing. If nothing is highlighted, then what 
I paste into exmh is different from what I paste into other windows. To be more 
specific, here's what gets pasted if nothing is highlighted:Application       What gets pastedXEmacs            whatever was last selected unless it was last selected in exmh
xterm             same as XEmacs
AbiWord           nothing
Nedit             nothing
sedit             Whatever was last highlighted in sedit and overwrittenThe last needs some amplification. If I highlight something in sedit, then 
obviously that's what gets pasted. If the highlighting is off, then what gets 
pasted is NOT what was last highlighted in sedit, but what was last highlighted 
and typed over (I have ""Type Kills SEL"" on.).It seems that exmh and sedit are the oddballs here. Very often when I try to 
paste something in sedit I end up muttering WTF??--

THE MISSING LINK | Scot has cyber tomb with a viewSometimes an epitaph just can't be the last word. Billy Kemp was a
great Scot who died a couple of years ago at the young age of 52. He
was a councilman, husband, father and pillar of his community. His
family couldn't possibly post all that on a tombstone. But they did
manage to fit http://www.billykemp.org.uk/ on there. Yep, Kemp's
tombstone doubles as a billboard for his Web site, created
posthumously by his son as a tribute to his father's life. The grave
site has gotten more than 33,000 hits, perhaps more visits than the
gravesite!SOURCE: vnunet

version of that WordInfo object is over twice as large as the string
representation.  So we could get a 50% decrease in size just by using
the string representation instead of the pickle, right?Something about that logic seems wrong to me, but I can't see what it
is.  Maybe pickling is good for heterogeneous data types, but every
value of our big dictionary is going to have the same type, so there's a
ton of redundancy.  I guess that explains why it compressed so well.Neale

GET WINDOWS XP TIPS: Months after the release of Windows XP Professional and Home editions, people are still learning the nuances of Microsoft's newest operating system. Whether you've been using it for a while or are planning to upgrade to the new OS soon, this ebook is right up your alley. 
GET YOUR COPY 
of Lockergnome's Top 50 Windows XP tips now!    This is of course belated, as I'm sending it on the 18th, but Happy Birthday to Lori!One thing about MacWorld should excite mp3 junkies -- the iPod just got 
even bigger, with a 20GB version and Apple officially endorses Windows 
compatibility. Actually, the good news is, the 5GB and 10GB versions 
came down in price. Hearing that the only ""officially"" functional 
Windows player is MusicMatch Jukebox Plus is a serious downer, in my 
opinion. Sure, MusicMatch is a decent player, but with plenty of great 
free players on the market, why do we want to purchase a software 
player in addition to the $299+ hardware unit?At first glance, it looks like Apple is only paying lipservice to true 
Windows compatibility. I've seen no mention of any additional 
functionality, besides song management via one media playing utility. Mediafour's 
XPlay remains a 
better option, in my opinion. In addition to allowing you to use an 
iPod with almost any media player made for Windows, it assists with 
contact management, via Outlook vCards, in addition to making the 
iPod an additional drive on your PC. At a mere $10 more than MusicMatch 
Jukebox Plus, XPlay blows the doors off Apple's officially endorsed player.Lori and I made the five and a half hour drive to St. Louis for this year's 
SIC without a hitch. I just missed a 
face-to-face introduction to John Lal, of 
winferno.com, although I'm sure 
we'll meet tomorrow. John's the guy behind the 
free copy of Research-Desk 
for all Gnomedex attendees. Shortly after arrival, I enjoyed dinner with 
the eSellerate gang, with a 
discussion about GnomeTomes and 
what the future holds.Every time I travel, I'm reminded just how slow dialup really is. Fortunately, my 
Crosspaths.net connection allows me 
to send mail via my Lockergnome account, unlike most of the national dialup 
services. Crosspaths is technically an Iowa ISP, although the have points of 
presence in almost every major city in the country. If you're a dialup user, 
you may want to take a look at their offerings, regardless of where you live. Lori 
has used their DSL service for two years now, and they've been nothing short of 
outstanding in dealing with customer service queries.

Unknown artists across a variety of genres offer free mp3 downloads of 
selected tracks, with an option to purchase songs on CD for the price 
of shipping and handling. All CDs are professionally mastered works, 
so you're getting label quality releases, without the jacked-up retail 
price tag. The mp3s let you decide if the album is worth you $4.95. 
The only thing I find odd about this site is their proclamation of 
paying artists 50% of distribution profits, which I have to assume is 
50% of zero, since the CDs are free. The artist selection contains 
some solid releases by talented artists, regardless.

Click for DetailsWho's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (NR) 1966
Adapted Play - 131min
Reviewer's Tilt (10)
 Before directing Catch-22 and The Graduate, Mike Nichols made his big screen debut directing this adroit adaptation of Edward Albee's play ""Who's afraid of Virginia Woolf?""  Nominated for thirteen, and winner of five, Academy Awards, this dark tale centers on history professor George (Richard Burton), and his wife Martha (Elizabeth Taylor), daughter of the college president.  At first George and Martha appear to be the average Ozzie and Harriet, an aging, well-adjusted, educated couple, comfortable with their lives and their love.  George and Martha quickly shatter this illusion, as they return from a faculty cocktail party, to exchange a caustic barrage of verbal barbs.  Just as quickly, however, the couple turns witty and civil when the young new biology professor Nick (George Segal) and his shy, but pretty wife Honey (Sandy Dennis) stop by for a nightcap. Unfortunately for Nick and Honey, the sardonic exchange does not disappear, it merely changed guise.  Soon Nick and Honey find themselves helpless pawns in the elder couple's sick-witted exchange.  Throughout the remainder of the movie, George and Martha dance their finely choreographed, oft-rehearsed dance of despise. The two alternate the lead, alternately dishing out and enabling the abuse, but they never miss a step.  Thankfully, writer Albee's sublime play translates to the big screen almost unadulterated. Taylor and Burton deliver his lines with great force and impeccable timing.  At one point George proposes ""Now that we're through with Humiliate the Host...and we don't want to play Hump the Hostess yet...how about a little round of Get the Guests?""  This provides some idea of the precarious twist of uncomfortable wit that drives the action from start to finish. Albee's stellar writing notwithstanding, the real star of this film is Taylor and Burton's alchemy, converting Albee's words into cinematic gold.  Ok, I will grant you that playing a pair of aging, drunk, selfish lovers may not have been much of a stretch.  Both actors, however, deliver their lines with the chilling reality of a serial killer describing his most gratifying slaying.  Often unpleasant and disturbing, this film never allows you to relax or look away.   Simultaneously seamlessly smooth, and ingeniously rocky this is not a ""feel good"" movie. ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"" is, however, a memorable film that will stick with you for years to come.

"Every once in a while, I get notifications in my root mailbox that my
personal mail is being rejected.  The message is 'No Catalogue Servers
available at this time.'  Since I use razor V1 through Mail::Audit
(using is_spam), I tried several ways to try to trap this error and
allow my mail to be delivered on these occassions but nothing seemed
to work.I started digging through the code and found several uses of exit
inside the razor code.  This is a very anti-social thing for a module
to do.  It takes away my option to bypass the spam check and deliver
the mail anyway.  The razor modules should signal errors through die
or warn.  razor-check could catch these and, knowing it's being called
during mail delivery, issue an appropriate message and exit status for
the MTA.  The razor modules don't know who's calling them and
shouldn't make this decision.  I'm wondering how much legitimate mail
I'm missing because of this.I certainly hope this is being addressed in the new version.--

  | From: ""Matthew French"" 
  | 
  | Niall asked:
  |  > I have about 60G of data which I need to copy from one disk to
  |  > another.  [ ... ] The problem is the bulk of the data [ ... ]
  |  > have two directory entries i.e. there is a hard link [ ... ]
  | 
  | How about something like:
  | 
  |    cd {dest.dir}
  |    tar -C {source.dir} cf - | tar xf -
  | 
  | tar cf - will pipe the tar file to stdout and tar xf - will untar it. This
  | should keep permissions and links, and if you do it as root you will keep
  | the owners too... :)
  | 
  | Not tested, though. You may need other flags as well. the above (or something close to it) will work. however, the data will be read and written twice by the
 1st (source) `tar', and read twice by the 2nd (sink) `tar',
 albeit only written once as the sink realizes the second
 copy is a hard link to the first.  with c.60Gb of data,
 that will make a difference, at least in time and CPU
 resource consumed (albeit, in this case, not storage). the issue here is tar(1) (and cpio(1)) archives always
 contain the data for each name of a hard link.  this is
 (probably) for several reasons, and is not necessarily a
 bad thing.   e.g., it provides a degree of redundancy to
 help cope with bad media. the source `tar' is creating an archive, which is being
 written down the pipe (to be consumed by the sink `tar').
 that is why storage is not an issue per se here, as the
 full archive is not ""saved"" --- if it were, you'd need
 at least 2x60Gb, or over 120Gb!   (the extra is `tar's
 overhead, which is minimal but does add up, esp. when
 a ""large"" blocking factor is used.)cheers!

restrictorism principles, then,) conference/exhibition and get 30 invited
exhibitors, with lecturedemos, on elastic polity, concepts of public
responsibility have gone rather far off theory into quartering.The way I reckon it, they plan on fixing the seats/plane and security
problem by further sectioning airplanes:
	1- Checked luggage
	2- Calcium formerly in passengers and crew
	3- The rest of the passengers
	4- The cabin and crew, who get a calcium substitute more
	   readily controlled by a quorum of preservatory agencies.
	5 (optional:) - Premium services and DRM for checked laptops.
They reactivate calcium channels and put the calcium back when
you arrive.  If you don't like it, you have to claim it as they put the
calcium back, subject to retries, and you have to remember the flight
number you actually arrived on to do that....and you suddenly know all about vendors!http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork",Safe Email

IM client vulnerable to attack James Pearce, ZDNet Australia  Users of messenger client Trillian are vulnerable to attack, according to
information security analyst John Hennessy.Hennessy has published a proof-of-concept showing the latest version of
Trillian, v0.73, is vulnerable to a buffer-overflow attack that will
allow individuals with malicious intent to run any program on the
computer.Trillion is a piece of software that allows you to connect to ICQ, AOL
Instant Messenger, MSN Messenger, Yahoo! Messenger and IRC with a single
interface, despite some companies actively avoiding messenger
interoperability.According to Jason Ross, senior analyst at amr interactive, in June 2002
there were 28,000 home users of Trillian in Australia, about 0.4 percent
of the Internet population, and 55,000 people using it at work, about 1.8
percent of the Internet population.David Banes, regional manager of Symantec security response, told ZDNet
Australia the code appeared to be valid.""With these sort of things you have to find some process that would
accept a connection, then throw loads of random data at it and get it to
crash,"" he said. ""Once it's crashed, you can try to find a way to exploit
it.""He said the proof-of-concept that was published is designed to run on
Notepad, but could be easily modified to run any program on the system.
He said the problem was easy to fix by ""writing protective code around
that particular piece to more closely validate the data around that
piece.""""Because people are pushed for productivity you tend to leave out the
checks and balances you should put in, which is why we have all these
buffer overflows and exploits out there now,"" said Banes.Cerulean Studios, creator of Trillian, was contacted for comment but had
not responded by the time of publication.------------------------------------------------------------------------For all security-related news, including updates on the latest viruses,

                  URGENT AND NOBLE PROPOSALATTN: DIRECTOR.
DEAR ,I wish to extend my greeting to you and your entire
family. I got your contact from the ivoirian chamber
of commerce, I prayed over it and selected your name
among other names because of its esteeming
nature.Morever,after my strong prayers and fasting,
God reveals to me that you are straight forward,
Honest and GodÂ’s person.
This is the reason I never waste time to propose you
this business for our mutual benefits. Infact, You
will never regret it provided you give me your
possible best cooperate hand, Believe me.I am MARTIN FRANCIS, A cote dÂ’ivoire national and the
only child of late Mr and Mrs FRANCIS. My late father
was the former financial controller of CÃ´te dÂ’Ivoire
telecommunication (CITELCOM). My father died due to
the heat of political crisis in my country recently
last years.But,I am motherless since,before my fathers
late and the death of my mother on 26 SEPTEMBER 1993
was as a result of spiritual attack by our family
member who hated her just because of my fathers
wealth.
Moreover, they tried their own part as well against my
father and myself but negative because God almighty
is available at our side. Infact God is wonderful.
Although, before the death of my father in one of the
private hospital here, he secretly revealed to me
specifically on family matters and mostly the safety
of his monies us$16,500,000.00 (sixteen million,five 
hundred thousand united states dollars) which he
deposited in a bank here in my county Abidjan, 
CÃ´te dÂ’Ivoire and used my name,MARTIN FRANCIS as the
next of kin for the deposits. This amount was accrued
from an over-invoiced contract award for the
construction of an underground telephone network to
replace the former in the new city (Yamoussoukro) and
other major cities also for installation of the
microwave station awarded to my late father,Mr JOSEPH
FRANCIS in 1999 to expatiate companies. In fact, after
the finished payment of  contract workers, my late
father deposited this fund in a bank as the full
beneficiary contractor of the said company (CITELCOM)
this is the fund I want to transferred to your account
as the beneficiary contractor due for payment,providedyou cooperate.Therefore I am seeking your full and
urgent  assistance for the telegraphic transfer of
this sixteen million and five hundred thousand united
states dollars, us$16,500.000 US dollars to your
designated account for a very good business investment
in your country as due to the instruction my father
gave to me before he late. What I require from you are
as follows.1.Your private telephone and fax number for easy and
strict communication
2.Your bank particular for smooth and successful
remittance of this monies to your nominated account
3.You have to make necessary arrangement for me to
meet with you immediately the monies is been
transferred in your account and confirmed by you.
4.You have to secure a college for me in your country
to further my education. 
5.You will have to be my guardian and part of the
joint venture investment when I get to your country.Furthermore, my late father had instructed me to offer
20 % of the total sum to the person who is to assist
me out for the transferring of this fund.Moreover, I wish to assure you that this transaction
would be concluded within the next(3)days you signify
interest to assist me out.I suggest that this
transaction should be handled in strict confidence
because I have work out fine every modalities
concerning the transfer of this fund. 
Please and please, kindly hasten up the arrangement as
quickly as possible because my late father instructed
me not to invest this monies in this country CÃ´te-
dÂ’Ivoire. That I should invest abroad of my choice for
the benefit of myself and for security reasons.Thank very much in anticipation of your
acknowledgement of this business proposal and do not
hesitate to contact me immediately you receive this
message with this my direct telephone number mentioned
above, tel : + 225 05775748 for us to proceed
immediately. Please and please, donÂ’t fail.waiting for your urgent response nowthanks very much again and God bless.best regardsMARTIN FRANCIS.

it might.  and that was my point, having these mythical symlinks point
to the device+inode is not simple.  just like the unrm thing, it might
be possible, but hard links and soft links are the best implementations
that have survived to date on unix.  windows shortcuts are kinda weird -
they're really an application level thing.mac aliases seem to take the idea of unix symlinks (linking by filename)
along with the concept of device+inode.  i don't know mac internals,
but i seem to remember being told it tried the former first, and then
tried the latter.  how it would deal with the 2nd example i mentioned i
dunno - i'm not certain if the mac version of inodes would suffer from
that (maybe the fs identifier for the file included the creation time
or something like that).> how do i control this 'symlinks magically link to new files' feature?i think it would be difficult.  it would also fail to work in numerous
situations.kevin--

"commercialization of nasa technology hey , i thought you might like to take a look at viaspace the cohen report viaspace was founded in 1998 as a spin - off of the caltech / nasa jet propulsion laboratory ( jpl ) to transform technologies originally developed for space and defense markets into profitable commercial enterprises . viaspace seeks opportunities in high growth markets delivering on problems with growing global relevance by leveraging unique expertise not available elsewhere in the commercial world . viaspace sees a compelling business opportunity in the homeland security public safety and fuel cell markets . viaspace target markets are in excess of $ 100 b / yr and growing with a cagr of over 20 % . in the past six years viaspace has created three companies , spectrasensors , qwip technologies and vialogy corp . their websites provide a background on the commercialization of nasa technology , ( spectrasensors . com , qwip . com , vialogy . com ) . the company ' s current focus is on three subsidiaries , direct methanol fuel cell , arroyo sciences and ionfinity . direct liquid methanol fuel cell direct methanol fuel cell corporation ( dmfcc ) will provide disposable methanol fuel cell cartridges for tomorrow ' s fuel cell - powered portable electronic devices such as laptop computers and cell phones . methanol fuel cells ( dfmc ) are expected to replace lithium ion batteries in portable electronic devices . a dfmc can power a laptop for up to 10 hours on a disposable cartridge that costs $ 2 to $ 3 . a smaller cartridge can power a cell phone for up to 3 weeks . we believe consumers will spend a few extra dollars for the convenience of keeping their cell phones and other electronic devices operating . as a disposable product , it generates recurring revenue for dmfcc . the technology is protected by over 70 issued and pending patents . toshiba , nec , sanyo , and samsung have unveiled prototype fuel cell powered products that more than double the operating time over existing battery technology . dmfcc has opened a tokyo office to work closely with japanese manufacturers . arroyo sciences , inc . arroyo focuses on the fusion of radio frequency , nuclear and electromagnetic imaging to deliver information products in transportation , supply chain , security , logistics assurance and first responder safety markets . the micro tracker product enables a wireless tracking for first responders in hazardous environments . this product combines radio frequency identification ( rfid ) tags , wireless digital communications , ground positioning satellite ( gps ) , data for 2 - d and 3 - d geolocation determination , geographic information system ( gis ) and sensor technologies . real - time processing of many high data content inputs is required for the instantaneous assessment of danger . applications include improved safety for fire department personnel in emergency situations , improved coordination of multi - agency deployments and extended operations in hazardous environments . the cobra product uses the imaging and sensing technology to provide early threat indicators for coastal surveillance and public infrastructure protection such as ports , power plants , airports , and telecommunication facilities . real time sensory and image data is processed and software is customized to discriminate between friend and foe . deepscan is a software system that provides automatic analysis of air and seaport cargo containers based on x - ray and gamma ray imaging . arroyo is currently using deepscan for bomb and hazardous material detection in cargo . ionfinity ionfinity has developed the next generation mass spectrometry ( ms ) technology that is 10 times more sensitive than existing ms , with a 10 times increase in mass range . higher sensitivity enables the comprehensive monitoring and detection of biological , chemical and nuclear contaminants . the current market for ms is estimated at $ 1 . 2 billion annually . the compact size and rugged portability will expand the market . new applications include enabling port inspection personnel to detect traces of contraband , epa air quality monitoring and assisting in hazardous material clean up . additional projects under review projects not included in our forecast are ( 1 ) a water purification technology and ( 2 ) interactive radio . the water purification system displays impressive statistics in that it can convert brackish , sewage or industrial wastewater into ultra - pure water . the water system is scalable from house to municipal usage and will last 25 years while requiring minimal maintenance . the interactive radio enables a listener to receive emails or web sites delivered in response to what is broadcast . the radio station essentially receives input from listeners that could enhance advertising and improve vertical market focus . forecasts and valuation we expect revenues for dmfcc will be driven by ( 1 ) increasing wireless usage of computing devices and ( 2 ) the existing need to extend cell phone battery life . we expect revenues for dmfcc will commence in 2007 and grow to $ 195 million by 2009 . homeland security expenditures on airport and seaport security will be a primary revenue driver for arroyo sciences , which will begin to generate revenues in 2005 , and will grow to $ 90 million in 2009 . we expect commercial revenues for ionfinity will commence in late 2007 , and will be $ 10 million in 2009 . beyond 2009 , total revenues will grow at a 60 % to 80 % rate for several years from existing and new products . contracting with existing manufacturers , we expect operating margins will be in the low 40 % range by 2009 . our initial forecasts indicate a fair value range from $ 8 . 40 to $ 11 . 10 based on the projected growth for the 2009 to 2012 timeframe . the graph below outlines our valuation analysis . directors and management dr . carl kukkonen , is the ceo and founding partner . dr kukkonen was director for space microelectronics and manager of supercomputing at caltech / jpl , where he worked for 14 years . prior to jpl , dr . kukkonen was the leading expert on hydrogen as alternative fuel at ford motor company . aj abdallat , coo , and vp of business development has been with viaspace since inception , after working in business development at hewlett -
