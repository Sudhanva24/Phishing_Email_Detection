Category of High-Density ATA DrivesMILPITAS, Calif., September 9, 2002-Maxtor Corporation (NYSE: MXO), a worldwide leader in hard disk drives and 
data storage solutions, today announced Maxtor MaXLineTM, its newest 
generation of ATA drives designed specifically for rapidly emerging 
enterprise storage applications including near-line, media storage and 
network storage. The MaXLine family features two critical differentiators: 
huge capacities up to 320 GB for corporate archiving and media recording; 
and unique manufacturing and quality for 24/7 operations with mean time to 
failure (MTTF) rates exceeding one million hours.The MaXLine family is designed to bring hard disk drives into ""near-line"" 
archive applications. By adding a layer of MaXLine drives to archive 
architectures, companies can instantly recover time-critical data including 
executive e-mail, transaction data and accounting data that may need to be 
recovered on demand.These new drives are designed to solve another enterprise problem with the 
storage of video, media and audio conference call files. Even compressed, 
these files take up tremendous amounts of high-cost server space. Priced 
starting around $299.95 to $399.95 MSRP, Maxtor's MaXLine family offers 
high capacity drives for enterprise applications at price points between 
traditional ATA and SCSI drives.For system OEMs and white box builders, MaXLine offers high-density, 
easy-to-integrate storage for use in entry-level and mid-size server 
environments.""The demand for instant recall of archived data is expanding as companies 
are meeting their obligations to quickly access executive e-mails, 
financial documents and transaction records,"" said Mike Dooley, senior 
director of marketing for the Desktop Products Group at Maxtor. ""Users may 
not need to access information in these applications on a daily basis, but 
when they do need access, it must be instant. Recent advances in ATA 
technology and our manufacturing processes allow us to build upon our 
legacy of experience and provide our customers with a family of premium ATA 
hard drives that can be integrated into a variety of systems for these 
enterprise applications.""The MaXLine family includes the 5400-RPM MaXLine II, designed for 
capacities up to 320 GB and the 7200-RPM MaXLine Plus II, designed for 
capacities up to 250 GB. At these capacities, MaXLine offers higher storage 
density than many tape and optical solutions. These drives have also been 
tested and are projected to meet enterprise reliability requirements, 
already exceeded by prior drives employing the same robust Maxtor designs, 
which exceed MTTF of over one million hours. These drives will also carry a 
three-year warranty.The MaXLine II and MaXLine Plus II feature the Maxtor Fast DriveTM 
UltraATA/133 interface for data transfer speeds up to 133 MB per second. 
The MaXLine II and MaXLine Plus II will be available with next-generation 
serial ATA interface for higher performance. At 150 MB per second maximum 
data transfer rate, serial ATA improves hard drive performance to keep pace 
with the rapidly increasing performance requirements of data intensive 
environments and enterprise applications.With a point-to-point connection architecture, and rich command set for 
managing hard drive activity and data flow along the interface, serial ATA 
advances the performance and efficiency of the drive to system interface. 
The interface's reduced pin count allows for simpler cabling which in turn 
allows better airflow within a system and further benefits the user with 
increased design flexibility and hot plug capability.""Maxtor's MaXLine family of drives provide a solution for storing data that 
has previously been too expensive to keep on disk,"" said Dave Reinsel, 
analyst at IDC. ""The ATA drives offer a great value, low cost per GB and 
when integrated into storage systems and file servers offer a compelling 
cost-effective alternative to tape libraries and optical drives, which have 
been the traditional solutions used for near-line applications.""Availability
Limited qualification units of the parallel ATA versions of Maxtor MaXLine 
II and MaXLine Plus II are now available; with volume units available in 
the fourth quarter. Qualification units of the MaXLine II and MaXLine Plus 
II with serial ATA will be available later this month with volume shipments 
scheduled to begin in the first quarter of 2003.About Maxtor

"In 1957, a monastery in Thailand was being relocated and a group of monks
was put in charge of moving a giant clay Buddha. In the midst of the move
one of the monks noticed a crack in the Buddha. Concerned about damaging the
idol, the monks decided to wait for a day before continuing with their task.
When night came, one of the monks came to check on the giant statue. He
shined his flashlight over the entire Buddha. When he reached the crack he
saw something reflected back at him. The monk, his curiosity aroused, got a
hammer and a chisel and began chipping away at the clay Buddha. As he
knocked off piece after piece of clay, the Buddha got brighter and brighter.
After hours of work, the monk looked up in amazement to see standing before
him a huge solid-gold Buddha.Many historians believe the Buddha had been covered with clay by Thai monks
several hundred years earlier before an attack by the Burmese army. They
covered the Buddha to keep it from being stolen. In the attack all the monks
were killed, so it wasn't until 1957, when the monks were moving the giant
statue, that the great treasure was discovered. Like the Buddha, our outer
shell protects us from the word: our real treasure is hidden within. We
human beings unconsciously hide our inner gold under a layer of clay. All we
need to do to uncover our gold is to have the courage to chip away at our
outer shell, piece by piece.Could you be sitting on your own gold mine? Did you know the average
American can retire a millionaire on his or her current income? Then, why
don't they? It's simple. They haven't been taught that they could. They are
taught to use debt to get what they want now instead of having their money
work for them. They pay too much in taxes. They are wasting money every
month and don't even realize it. In short, they are financially unhealthy.

"BTW, I've been thinking a little about the RPMs and other packages.
Already the PLD guys are distributing 3 rpms:  - perl-Mail-SpamAssassin          the perl modules.  - spamassassin          the ""spamassassin"" and ""spamd"" scripts,
          spamd rc-file etc.  - spamassassin-tools          mass-check, masses directory stuff, etc.
          for generating rescore data from corpora.This seems like a good way to do it; this way, stuff which just needs
the perl modules doesn't need to require the full RPM be installed,
with RC files in init.d etc.It's been adopted in the distributed .spec file, anyway.Theo, BTW, what's the eval test you add in the tvd version of the RPM?--j.

no, there really isn't an IMAP server which knows how to do this.The longer answer is, UW-IMAP claims it does, but doesn't do a good 
job, and doesn't update scan caches, unseen, etc.You may have better luck while on the road using raw mh commands to 
read you e-mail if you have ssh access to your internal environment.
I've been doing this for quite a long time, and, after the learning 
curve of the mh command set (which I still don't know completely),
I'm quite able to access my e-mail and respond to those e-mails which 
require a response.Another option is using mutt as your mail client when you're remotely 
accessing e-mail.  Mutt does a decent job of dealing with mh folders, 
though it doesn't update scan caches or unseen files either.  But it 
is a decent interface alternative to raw mh, and it's quite 
customizable.The real answer to your question is that we need not an IMAP server 
that understands mh folders, but an mh server to which a local client 
could connect to.  In theory, it shouldn't be too hard (technically) 
to cobble this together with ssh.  Replace all of exmh's calls to mh 
commands with a wrapper which uses ssh to lob these commands over to 
a remote system, and dump the output back into the local exmh client.-- Seeya,
Paul

work on client's systems.My limited experience of Java started a few years ago when support on
Linux was so terrible that I ran away screaming and haven't come back yet.Microsoft has announced that they plan to remove Java from Windows.
They took it out of XP already and it has to be installed with a

At least that is the case when then language you used is available on

time out to write email while waiting for a job to run).  Sure I could
wait 5 years until everyone's PC is fast enough to generate random EC's
in no time, when any twit will be able to program inefficient code

I'm sure Java is fine for some stuff, as is C or whatever.  Horses for

Hey Joel,
  Your message wasn't clear if you are cancelling a
regular earthlink account or the Omnisky inherited one. 
I'm sure if you call their customer service number
they can unsubscribe you.   I took me 4 tries,
so make sure you get a confirmation number.  They'll
try and not give you one and ignore your call just
to make it really inconvenient.  http://support.earthlink.net/support/CONTACT/phone.jspOut of interest, what search engine and term did you

"uk submission of positions just to follow up on james ' s note of yesterday - my apologies for being out the elimination of the requirement to ' grab ' the fx and ir market environment from houston ( and consequently use european data ) can improve our ability to kick the overnight batch processing off earlier in the evening . james and i will be working with brian hudson to determine the timetable for effecting this change the revised batch start time would improve the opportunity to detect any system failure and complete a rerun of the valuation process so as to deliver completed results by the time the risk management team arrive at their desks in the morning . system failures are the most significant problem we face in delivering timely information to houston . consequently the probability of meeting current reporting deadlines would be greatly improved given that we will have full it overnight support covering for any it failure and curve input validation processes on trade date . indeed given the successful completion of all overnight runs we are able to deliver officialisation of all valuation systems and most spreadsheets ( david hardy is in final testing of the eastern spreadsheet feed ) by the 10 am deadline ( houston 4 am ) flash p & l by the lpm deadline ( houston 7 am ) completion of the final dpr to be submitted to houston by the 5 pm deadline ( houston 11 am ) james and i are currently finalising a document reviewing all possible changes to business processes that could improve these times . this is in addition to working with commercial and it to assess the possibility of delivering significantly faster revaluation systems that could assist in delivering a trade date control process . i can confirm that there is significant work to do in this area , however , we are dedicated to meeting the objectives of improved / more real time control . please feel free to call if the above requires any additional commentary . regards mike - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - forwarded by mike jordan / lon / ect on 19 / 12 / 2000 15 : 06 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - james new 18 / 12 / 2000 09 : 10 to : rick buy / hou / ect @ ect cc : john sherriff / lon / ect @ ect , michael r brown / lon / ect @ ect , fernley dyson / lon / ect @ ect , mike jordan / lon / ect @ ect , ted murphy / hou / ect @ ect , gary hickerson / hou / ect @ ect subject : uk submission of positions rick , thanks you for your note below . we are today implementing a flash p & l process . we aim to report daily numbers at 7 am houston time and will start today with the p & l . we will build on this and hope to have draft positions and var for most books within a week or so . there will be a reconciliation of flash to final numbers which will be included in our return to houston . i will put together a note on the london dpr production process which goes into the process we currently have , the process we actually need to have , and the obstacles that are in the way . i would expect this to be finalised tomorrow . obtaining the usd interest rate curve on a more timely basis is just one of our problems but it is unfortunately by no means our only or most serious problem . james from : rick buy 15 / 12 / 2000 21 : 59 to : john sherriff / lon / ect @ ect , michael r brown / lon / ect @ ect , mike jordan / lon / ect @ ect cc : gary hickerson / hou / ect @ ect , ted murphy / hou / ect @ ect subject : uk submission of positions need your help on the following : each day we are delayed in finalising var , p & l and positions because the uk must wait for a usd interest rate curves before submitting their data to houston . i am also told that it is really not necessary to wait for this curve and the data could be submitted close of business london . even if there was some minor inaccuracy from this method it would be better than what we have now . this would greatly improve the efficiency ( by 4 to 6 hours ) in reporting to senior management . can you guys initiate this change or get me to the right person there . thanks , rick",Safe Email

command line, if you use sh or ksh:	for f in `folders -fast -r`

things right.  Like making indices for each folder, and not just by
date, but also by sender, message size, subject.  So I can sort by any
column instantly.I believe this is possible, too, with an IMAP compliant reader,
provided the IMAP server makes such indices.I am facing the fact that exmh has been left behind in some industry
standards.  I use it for my personal mail.  My mail server runs unix,
and I connect over ssh and tunnel my X traffic over ssh.  With a slow
link, this makes exmh very slow.  And mime handling is pretty bad
compared with modern mailers.  I am just scared to move.  I've been
using MH or nmh since 1985 and exmh since 1995.  17 years is a long
time!_______________________________________________

"Hi all,I've decided at last to test the ALSA sound drivers. As usual the result is
that I've spent much more time repackaging the darn thing than actually
testing the functionalities or trying to hear the great sound quality
people seem to think it outputs... but hey, some of you will benefit from
that, right? ;-)I've got the whole thing working on a Valhalla system, but the packages
should easily install or at least recompile on Enigma, Limbo/(null) and
maybe others, who knows ;-)Here are quick instructions for those of you that wish to try it out :
- Recompile the ""alsa-driver"" source rpm for your running kernel
  (you can install the binary package if you're using the i686 2.4.18-10)
- Install this ""alsa-driver"" package
- Install the ""alsa-libs"" package
- Install the ""alsa-utils"" packageNow go to this URL and find out what you need to change in your
/etc/modules.conf file to replace the default OSS driver loading :
http://www.alsa-project.org/alsa-doc/
(very complete and very good documentation!)
Hopefully you'll see that your card *is* supported ;-)Reboot, or remove by hand your current sound modules (you'll probably need
to stop many applications to free the sound resource...) ""by hand"" and
insert the new ones. If all is well you've got ALSA working! (""dmesg"" to
check is a good idea), you now just need to adjust the volume levels with
e.g. aumix and alsamixer because everything is muted by default.With ""aplay"" you can already test files to see if you hear anything. You
can also install the XMMS plugin (seems to make my XMMS segfault on exit...
hmmm, but maybe it's another plugin) to listen to your good ol' mp3
files... that's it!It really isn't complicated, and has never been from what I see. The only
thing I disliked was to have to install from source... but as I can't
imagine myself doing that ;-) I've repackaged everything cleanly. Even the
/dev entries are included in the rpm package (and *not* created by an ugly
%post script, I insist!) and seamlessly integrate into the /etc/makedev.d
structure. There are also a few other noticeable differences with the
default provided ALSA spec files, for example I've split alsa-lib's
development files into an alsa-lib-devel package and included static
libraries... there are others of course (oh yes, the kernel version against
which the ""alsa-driver"" package is compiled gets neatly integrated in the
rpm release, so does the architecture!).I'm open to any comments or suggestions about these packages!Download :
http://ftp.freshrpms.net/pub/freshrpms/testing/alsa/Current spec files :
http://freshrpms.net/builds/alsa-driver/alsa-driver.spec
http://freshrpms.net/builds/alsa-lib/alsa-lib.spec
http://freshrpms.net/builds/alsa-utils/alsa-utils.spec
(All others, patches etc. : http://freshrpms.net/builds/ )MatthiasPS: As an extra bonus, I've also recompiled xine with alsa support! Simply
run ""xine -A alsa09"" and off you go! It may even support 5.1 and S/PDIF ;-)--

"re : hiring practices for summer interns sally , thanks for the e - mail regarding summer interns . i apologize that lexi and shelly were unable to provide you with the answers you were seeking . i wish that you had contacted either celeste or me to indicate that you were having difficulty . i have personally assured you on several occasions that i was available to either speak with you or meet with you if for some reason any member of my staff was not responsive . that being said please allow me to explain the recruiting strategy since i was instrumental in helping to set it . you are absolutely correct . it is great to do market research if time permits or it is regarding an issue of which we have little knowledge . as you are aware , over the past year we have engaged a professional recruiting firm ( brecker & merryman ) who has assisted us in a number of different market research projects . however , in my opinion , this issue is not one that required much research . i have been involved in recruiting in some way , shape or form at both the graduate and undergraduate level for the past 10 years . most major organizations , with the exception of the accounting firms , begin the summer intern recruiting process in early spring . there are actually some universities that do not allow recruitment of summer interns until after a certain date , particularly in the mba programs . for example , harvard does not allow an organization to come on campus and speak to first year students until january . as indicated , the firms that generally recruit in the fall are the accounting firms and they are primarily recruiting for "" spring "" internships . the recruiting strategy at enron is no different this year than it was last year with respect to summer interns . presentations were made in january however , because lexi has other school interviews that are already scheduled she will not be in a position to facilitate the interview process during the trip you have scheduled currently . as you are aware , in most instances , the dates for presentations and interviews are dictated by the respective universities and were secured in early august . if you would like for her to try and secure an interview schedule for a later date this fall she can certainly work with your schedule and her current schedule to support your efforts . i hope this has been helpful . i can understand and appreciate your frustration if you are not getting answers from the recruiter or her manager . again , i offer that i am available and willing to work with you if you are having difficulty with members of the program staff . please let me know what you decide about recruiting this fall for summer interns and whether i can be of any additional assistance . charlene",Safe Email

"Quoting Paul Linehan (plinehan@yahoo.com):> Anyway, I should have initiated a new thread for my different request
> about S.u.S.E. CDs.You'll probably want to buy a retail boxed set, e.g., via mail order.
The only editions of SuSE for i386 that are lawful to duplicate and
redistribute are as follows:SuSE Evaluation:  This is a single-CD ISO9660 image, currently at v. 7.0. 
If you don't mind having only one disk's worth of SuSE, and being
several revisions behind the boxed-set editions, this is quite good and 
recommended.SuSE Live Eval:  Another CD image, currently at v. 8.0, but this one
doesn't install to hard drives at all:  It's a demo disk.SuSE FTP Edition (for lack of an official name):  Not a CD image, but
the contents of ftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/suse/i386/current/ .  You would
have to mirror the ftp directory tree, and then figure out how to
install (e.g., over NFS).  Currently at v. 8.0.There are three (non-redistributable) boxed-set editions, at different
price points.I'm assuming in the above that you're talking about an i386-architecture
computer.  Slightly different answers apply for Alpha, IA64, SPARC, PPC,
SPARC64, PPC64, or S390.--

"Dear friend,I am Mrs. Sese-seko widow of late President Mobutu Sese-seko of Zaire, now known as Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). I am moved to write you this letter. This was in confidence considering my present circumstance and situation. I escaped along with my husband and two of our sons James Kongolo and Nzanga out of Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to Abidjan, Coted'ivoire where my family and I settled, while we later moved to settled in Morroco where my husband later died of cancer disease. However, due to this situation we decided to change most of my husband's billions of dollars deposited in Swiss bank and other countries into other forms of money coded for safe purpose because the new head of state of (Dr) Mr Laurent Kabila has made arrangement with the Swiss government and other European countries to freeze all my late husband's treasures deposited in some european countries. Hence, my children and I decided laying low in Africa to study the situation
till when things gets better. Like now that president Kabila is dead and the son taking over
(Joseph Kabila). One of my late husband's chateaux in Southern France was confiscated by the french government, and as such I had to change my identity so that my investment will not be traced and confiscated.I have deposited the sum Eighteen Million United State
Dollars (US$18,000,000,00.) With a security company for safe keeping. What I want you to do is to indicate yourinterest that you can assist us in receiving the money on our behalf, so that I can introduce you to my son (Kongolo) who has the out modalities for the claim
of the said funds. I want you to assist in investing this money, but I will not want my identity revealed.I will also want to acquire real/landed properties and
stock in multi-national companies and to engage in other safe and non-speculative investments as adviseby your good self. May I at this point emphasize the high level of
confidentiality, which this upcoming project demands,and hope you will not betray the trust and
confidence, which I repose in you.In conclusion, if you want to assist us, my son (Kongolo) shall divulgeto you all briefs regarding this project, tell you where
the funds are currently being maintained and also discuss remuneration for your services.For this reason kindly furnish us your contact information,that is your personal telephone and fax number for validation purpose and acknowledge receipt of this mail using the above email address.Yours sincerely,Mrs. Mariam M.

root=/dev/hda5, not /dev/md0 was because /dev/md0 wasn't booting - it
would barf with 'can't find init'. It turns out that this is because I was populating md0 with tar. Which
seems to have 'issues' with crosslinked files - for instance, it was
trying to make a hard link of glibc.so to hda - and failing. It was only
as I did it again with a friend present, that he spotted the errors, and
queried them. We noticed that the hard linked files just didn't exist on
the new rootfs. When we duplicated the filesystems with dump instead of tar, it worked
fine, I was able to tell lilo to use root=/dev/md0 and everything worked. Woohoo.Kate

"western issues update 9 - 07 - 2001 for questions or comments regarding this report please contact g . britt whitman at ex : 5 - 4014 or kristin walsh at ex : 3 - 9510 . executive summary ? british columbian government exploring energy issues ? bc hydro readies itself for transmission line sale ? bpa aborts additional rate increase , refutes california ' s overcharge claims bc government the bc liberals have announced that they are putting together a new policy task force on energy to deal with energy issues going forward . they will be looking at the province ' s energy resources and will be making recommendations in less than six months on the best way to move forward . the task force includes : jack ebbels , deputy minister of the ministry of energy and mines , chair peter meekison , energy policy consultant john bechtold , oil and gas expert erik westergaard , hydroelectricity expert brenda eaton , deputy minister to the premier our information is that the policy task force will look seriously at the offshore drilling and exploration issue and begin to determine timetables to start this process . additionally , the canadians are becoming increasingly rancorous over the 19 . 4 % us tariff on softwood timber exports coming to the states . a bc cabinet minister has made veiled threats to tie canadian energy exports to the united states to eliminating the softwood timber tariff . jean chretien himself has backed away from trade war talks , but intimated that reduction or elimination of the tariff will be critical to moving the oil and natural gas pipeline projects in northern bc along . bc hydro bc hydro chair larry bell is soft - peddling the bc liberals ' message of deregulation . coming under intense scrutiny , bell has already gone public to defend bc hydro ' s rate freeze and has stated that residential distribution and powerex operations will not be deregulated . we noticed , however , that he did not say whether or not information technology and transmission assets would be sold off - which appears is indeed going forth . we believe that bc hydro is in the process of preparing to accept bids for its assets and that a round of open negotiations will begin in the short - to - medium term . two big players to watch on the transmission privatization front are : trans - elect corporation , which has indicated it is watching the british columbia market very carefully and already owns the adjacent transmission lines in calgary ; and transconnect , which has been working with the rto - west group , which could eventually plug bc hydro ' s transmission systems into the rto west grid . bell has been talking about instituting a tiered - rate plan for bc ' s own energy - intensive industries , allowing energy - efficient plants to maintain their preferred rate , increasing rates for others . he is considering allowing private sector generators to sell directly to industry in bc . however , bell has not been as hot on "" clean coal "" generation as neufeld , having suggested that he has not yet seen an application of the technology , which has been economically and environmentally sound . strategically , hydro ' s export plans will likely look to include new partners across the border . from what we are seeing of the new chairman ' s position , it appears that bc hydro will attempt to sever the "" feeling of entitlement "" that bc ' s own energy - intensive industries have relied on . that is , hydro is snooping around the states for greener pastures after having had a taste of the california windfall last year . why commit to providing cheap power to local markets when you could be selling the same power for larger profits elsewhere ? bpa financial conditions to everyone ' s relief , bpa last week announced there would be no additional rate increase . in early august the agency had warned that its pre - third quarter review showed a possibility it would have to trigger the financial - based cost recovery adjustment clause ( fb crac ) , one of three cracs bpa and its customers adopted in the supplemental rate case to cope with erratic power prices . the load - based ( lb ) crac has already driven a 46 percent rate increase , and the fb crac could have added another 4 . 5 mills . but the agency said fresh data put its revenues above the trigger , so there will be no additional rate hike . additionally , we have also heard that bpa is still committed to spending roughly $ 186 million next year on fish and wildlife issues . ferc refunds although bpa has not issued an official statement , as a net supplier to california it is likely that bpa would be opposed to california ' s attempt to recoup over $ 1 . 5 billion in perceived overcharges from the pacific northwest . earlier this year , bpa responded to allegations of overcharging by issuing a rebuttal letter entitled "" bpa response to california iso study "" on 13 april 2001 which maintained that its operations were above reproach . bpa will look to pursue an insurance policy to insulate itself from cal - iso ' s allegations . pacific northwest utilities and other energy - using entities , such as the city of tacoma and the port of seattle , also have joined in the fray to pursue $ 2 billion in perceived overcharges . the name of the game on the west coast is to say that you were a net importer , not a net exporter during the period of time that is under investigation by ferc and the federal judge . everyone is beefing up their argument with load data to show they were actually buyers , not sellers . spill issues the power planning council has recommended spending more than $ 7 million for projects designed to mitigate for emergency power operations during this drought year . most of the funding would go to buy up spawning habitat along a tributary of the john day river in oregon , with $ 1 . 6 million to pay for irrigation screens in the yakima river . the $ 7 million is in addition to $ 24 million the council has already recommended to pay for projects designed to offset the emergency hydro operations that nearly stopped the spill program at main - stem dams . bpa had agreed to fund $ 9 . 3 million worth of the council ' s list . other projects recommended include funding the monitoring and evaluation of a salmon production project in the south fork of idaho ' s clearwater river , spending $ 300 , 000 to improve fish passage in a tributary of oregon ' s umatilla river , and installing stream flow gauges in the entiat , okanogan and wenatchee rivers .",Safe Email

only need to pick a small percentage of ham received as new training

) In tweaking my system to try to optimize the use of razor (this now from a network/connection/etc standpoint, not so much from a philosphical stance on what is or is not considered spam and who should decide it) I have come across a couple issues that I hope I may be able to get some relief on ...
) 
) 1) What *exactly* does ""Unable to connect to honor.cloudmark.com:2703; Reason: Operation now in progress."" mean ??? I have seen this error message some 1700 times today (between 2 clustered servers) representing a little over 1% failure rate. In an enterprise level I was hoping for more along the lines of maybe one-tenth that .....  It's a network error - That string is not created by 
  Razor Agents.  Its trying to connect and having trouble.  
  1700 times seems abnormally high.  How many successful
  connections were there in the same timespan?
) 2) Related somewhat to question 1: is there (or will there be if currently not) a way of adjusting the timeout the setting for the razor-check to await a response from the server it queries? I am running this as a sendmail milter and adjusting the milter timeouts won't help if the razor-check script times out first anyway ....  The timeout is hardcoded to 15 secs.  
  No plans right now to make that an option.
  You can always edit the source - Core.pm.  :)
) 3) What are the plans for fire.cloudmark, apt.cloudmark, ubik.cloudmark?  It seems that we have all these catalogue servers yet a good portion of the time, only one is available or the last discovery ends up only listing one (currently honor.cloudmark) in the cataloge.lst file.  The system is designed so servers can be added and 
  subtracted without the clients caring - if the razor
  client can't connect to a server, it re-discovers, getting
  all currently available servers and stores results locally.
) 4) What would be the implications/requirements/caveats of hosting a catalogue server or, at the minimum, a caching server (similar to the way mail-abuse.org, for example, does dns zone transfers of its rbl list -- I realize that this is a completely different mechanism, but you get the point I am driving at here). I realize that there is an issue of polluting the catalogue but perhpas there could be some way of certifying a catalogue server? What type of bandwidth considerations are we looking at here? (It is just the signatures that are actually transferred across the pipes, is it not?)  We are looking into releasing caching catalogue servers 
  for those besides us to use.
) It really looks like there is a great potential here for a very workable tool and if I can get some of these issues addressed or can even be of some assistance, all the better .....

"Hi,Newbie (to the list) question;  I've been working on porting the code to
run under Perl on Windows.  The changes are fairly minor and can be made
to interoperate with the current code.  How would one best go about
getting those changes merged in (better question, would there be
interest in such a version and getting those changes merged in)?Bill

technique you learned from relatives, books, talk shows, or the last child.Just when you get good at being a parent, you're done.Don't overprotect. I always called this ""First Baby Syndrome"". A 
neighbor at one point had a 4 or 5 year old that would choke on jello, 
probably because she never allowed him to have solid food until he was 
far too old, IMHO. I fed mine cereal, etc., early and let them get the 
hang of it. I always want my kids to be able to handle anything if I'm 
not there so I have them try it out when I am. (Within limits of 
course.) Of course, I'm now beating up my body at Vans Skate Park trying

"Depends on how much over spending vs. how much (and what type) over
regulation.The biggest problem with over regulation is the costs can be invisible.
It also has the ability to single out particular people, while over
spending spreads the damage more evenly.  Rent control would be an
example of a regulation solution that is in general worse than spending
tons of money on public housing.As for the definition of a liberal being someone who seeks to impose
both, I find no fault in that definition whatsoever.  The opinion that
EITHER we are spending too much OR we have too much regulation is pretty
much anathema to liberal politics.Finally, those who argue that there are private replacements for much
government regulation are not saying that a state of nature (no private
replacements, no government regulation) is better than government
regulation itself.And in my experience people who label themselves 'Green' (which does not
include everyone who loves trees and thinks smokestacks are ugly) is a
watermelon.

with a pregnant-looking Statue of Liberty on the Front) that stated that
even for the native US population, fertility had jumped in the last decade
and a half. I think the current figure for the US is a little over 2, but
not quite the ~2.1 of replacement rate. Combined with the very fertile
non-native population, the article implied the US was going to have a
significant increase in population over earlier predictions. As well, the
population would overall be more youthful, with associated implications for
being able to fund social programs, military spending, consumer spending,
etc.Europe did not show the same increase in fertility.Some actual data for the US are here:http://www.census.gov/population/pop-profile/2000/chap04.pdf

estimations, rather than casting fresh doubts. 52 a year *does* exceed 300, in under 6 years' time. The average
age of that study's participants was *39* -- meaning some 
participants may have had 20-25+ years of active sex life. At that age, and further ** HIV+ **, it seems reasonable to
think that some the participants may have actually slowed 
their pace a bit. So while this study's summary info is incomplete, you could 
easily conclude that the *average* participant in this one study
will have had over a thousand partners over a 40-50+ year active 
sex life, and so the even-more-active tails of the distribution
could easily be in the 3000+ range.Of course this says very little, almost nothing, about the overall 
population behavior, gay or straight, and the relative prevalence
of 3K+ individuals in either group. But it does strongly suggest 
that gay males with 3K+ partners exist in measurable numbers, so
people should stop treating Eugen's anecdotal estimation as if it
were sheer fantasy. BitBitch's own citation suggests otherwise.- Gordon",Safe Email

"I think that when considering deployment, a solution that supports all
Python platforms and not just the L|Unix crowd is desirable.Mac and PC users are more apt to be using a commercial MUA that's unlikely
to offer hooking ability (at least not easily). As mentioned elsewhere, even
L|Unix users may find an MUA solution easier to use then getting it added to
their MTA. (SysOps make programmers look like flaming liberals ;).)My notion of a solution for Windows/Outlook has been, as Guido described, a
client-server. Client side does pop3/imap/mapi fetching (of which, I'm only
going to implement pop3 initially) potentially on several hosts, spamhams
the incoming mail and puts it into one file per message (qmail style?). The
MUA accesses this ""eThunk"" as a server to obtain all the ham. Spam is
retained in the eThunk and a simple viewer would be used for manual
oversight on the spam for ultimate rejection (and training of spam filter)
and the ham will go forward (after being used for training) on the next MUA
fetch. eThunk would sit on a timer for 'always online' users, but I am not
clear on how to support dialup users with this scheme.Outbound mail would use a direct path from the MUA to the MTA. Hopefully all
MUAs can split the host fetch/send URL'sIMO, end users are likely to be more intested in n-way classification. If
this is available, the ""simple viewer"" could be enhanced to support viewing
via folders and (at least for me) the Outlook nightmare is over - I would
use this as my only MUA. (N.B. according to my recent readings, the best
n-way classifier uses something called a ""Support Vector Machine"" (SVM)
which is 5-8% more accurate then Naive Bayes (NB) ).I wonder if the focus of spambayes ought not to be a classifier that leaves
the fetching and feeding of messages to auxillary code? That way, it could
be dropped into whatever harness that suited the user's situation.David LeBlanc

Anarchist 'Scavenger Hunt' Raises D.C. Police Ire
Sat Sep 21, 3:37 PM ETWASHINGTON (Reuters) - An online ""anarchist scavenger
hunt"" proposed for next week's annual meeting of the
International Monetary Fund ( news - web sites) and
World Bank ( news - web sites) here has raised the ire
of police, who fear demonstrators could damage
property and wreak havoc.Break a McDonald's window, get 300 points. Puncture a
Washington D.C. police car tire to win 75 points.
Score 400 points for a pie in the face of a corporate
executive or World Bank delegate.D.C. Assistant Police Chief Terrance Gainer told a
congressional hearing on Friday that law authorities
were in talks to decide whether planned protests were,
""so deleterious to security efforts that we ought to
take proactive action.""Several thousand people are expected to demonstrate
outside the IMF and World Bank headquarters next
weekend.The Anti-Capitalist Convergence, a D.C.-based
anarchist group, is also planning a day-long traffic
blockade, banner-drops and protests against major
corporations in the downtown core.Chuck, the 37 year-old webmaster of the anarchist site
www.infoshop.org who declined to give his last name,
told Reuters his scavenger hunt was meant as a joke.""People were asking for things to do when they come to
D.C. We made the list to get people thinking, so they
don't do the boring, standard stuff,"" he said. ""I

"-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----CERT Advisory CA-2002-21 Vulnerability in PHP   Original release date: July 22, 2002
   Last revised: --
   Source: CERT/CC   A complete revision history can be found at the end of this file.Systems Affected     * Systems running PHP versions 4.2.0 or 4.2.1Overview   A  vulnerability  has been discovered in PHP. This vulnerability could
   be  used  by  a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code or crash PHP
   and/or the web server.I. Description   PHP  is  a  popular  scripting  language  in  widespread use. For more
   information about PHP, see          http://www.php.net/manual/en/faq.general.php   The  vulnerability  occurs  in the portion of PHP code responsible for
   handling  file uploads, specifically multipart/form-data. By sending a
   specially  crafted  POST  request  to  the web server, an attacker can
   corrupt  the  internal  data  structures used by PHP. Specifically, an
   intruder  can  cause  an improperly initialized memory structure to be
   freed.  In  most  cases, an intruder can use this flaw to crash PHP or
   the  web  server. Under some circumstances, an intruder may be able to
   take  advantage  of  this  flaw  to  execute  arbitrary  code with the
   privileges of the web server.   You  may  be  aware that freeing memory at inappropriate times in some
   implementations  of  malloc  and  free  does not usually result in the
   execution  of  arbitrary  code.  However, because PHP utilizes its own
   memory  management  system,  the  implementation of malloc and free is
   irrelevant to this problem.   Stefan  Esser  of  e-matters  GmbH has indicated that intruders cannot
   execute   code   on   x86   systems.   However,  we  encourage  system
   administrators  to  apply  patches  on  x86  systems  as well to guard
   against denial-of-service attacks and as-yet-unknown attack techniques
   that may permit the execution of code on x86 architectures.   This  vulnerability  was discovered by e-matters GmbH and is described
   in  detail  in  their  advisory.  The  PHP  Group  has  also issued an
   advisory.  A list of vendors contacted by the CERT/CC and their status
   regarding this vulnerability is available in VU#929115.   Although   this  vulnerability  only  affects  PHP  4.2.0  and  4.2.1,
   e-matters  GmbH  has  previously  identified  vulnerabilities in older
   versions  of  PHP.  If  you  are  running  older  versions  of PHP, we
   encourage you to review
   http://security.e-matters.de/advisories/012002.htmlII. Impact   A  remote  attacker can execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.
   An  attacker  may not be able to execute code on x86 architectures due
   to  the way the stack is structured. However, an attacker can leverage
   this  vulnerability  to  crash PHP and/or the web server running on an
   x86 architecture.III. SolutionApply a patch from your vendor   Appendix A contains information provided by vendors for this advisory.
   As  vendors report new information to the CERT/CC, we will update this
   section  and note the changes in our revision history. If a particular
   vendor  is  not  listed  below,  we  have not received their comments.
   Please contact your vendor directly.Upgrade to the latest version of PHP   If  a  patch  is  not  available  from your vendor, upgrade to version
   4.2.2.Deny POST requests   Until  patches  or an update can be applied, you may wish to deny POST
   requests.  The  following  workaround  is  taken from the PHP Security
   Advisory:     If  the  PHP  applications on an affected web server do not rely on
     HTTP POST input from user agents, it is often possible to deny POST
     requests on the web server.     In  the  Apache  web server, for example, this is possible with the
     following  code  included  in  the  main  configuration  file  or a
     top-level .htaccess file:     
        Order deny,allow
        Deny from all
          Note  that an existing configuration and/or .htaccess file may have
     parameters contradicting the example given above.Disable vulnerable service   Until  you  can upgrade or apply patches, you may wish to disable PHP.
   As a best practice, the CERT/CC recommends disabling all services that

          (4.2.0,  4.2.1)  of  PHP  in their products. Therefore, Caldera

          vulnerable function.FreeBSD          FreeBSD  does not include any version of PHP by default, and so
          is  not  vulnerable; however, the FreeBSD Ports Collection does
          contain  the  PHP4  package. Updates to the PHP4 package are in
          progress  and a corrected package will be available in the near
          future.Guardian Digital          Guardian  Digital  has not shipped PHP 4.2.x in any versions of

          is  not  vulnerable.  The  Mandrake Linux cooker does currently
          contain  PHP  4.2.1  and  will  be  updated shortly, but cooker
          should  not be used in a production environment and no advisory

"asl dictionary on cd-rom my recent query concerning the new american sign language ( asl ) dictionary on cd-rom generated a substantial response , both from this list and from slling - l . i have summarized the main points of these responses below . please bear in mind that i have not seen the products in question . the dictionary reviewed on pbs is the american sign language dictionary on cd-rom by martin sternberg and is distributed by harpercollins . the following is the positive point that recurs in people 's messages : - - it is at the moment the only published asl dictionary that includes motion videos of asl signs , which serves to disambiguate unclarities in printed representations . the following are the negative points that recur in people 's messages : - - the dictionary is based too heavily on english , being essentially an english - to - asl dictionary . this both makes it hard ( at times , impossible ) to get an idea of the internal structure of the asl lexicon , and makes it less useful to native signers . ( there is , however , some categorization into semantic groups . ) there are also more specific problems arising from the failure to make asl distinctions that are not made overtly in english ( e . g . english "" lecture "" is used as a headword , while the asl equivalent is specifically a verb , not a noun ; classifiers are almost completely omitted ) . - - the dictionary is based on sternberg 's book-form dictionary of the early 1980s , and fails to take account of recent developments in the study of asl . - - there may be technical quality concerns , but since i have n't seen the product i ' m not in a position to judge . it seems to work better on more modern machines , and the mac version seems to work better than the windows version . alternatives : the following other cd-rom asl dictionary projects were drawn to my attention : - - multemedia dictionary of asl ( mm-dasl ) , release planned for summer of 1995 . this dictionary is based generally on the work of william stokoe ( who is involved in the project ) . it allows direct lookup of asl signs , incorporates recent linguistic work on asl , and is assisted by a panel of native asl users . for details , please contact sherman wilcox , university of new mexico ( wilcox @ mail . unm . edu ) . - - asl dictionary on cd-rom developed by dennis cokely at linstok press , 4020 blackburn lane , burtonsville , md 20866 , and alpha and beta tested by ken rust at madonna university , who should be contacted for further details ( rust @ smpt . munet . edu ) . thanks to : jacqueline anderson , nancy frishberg , marian macchi , mark a . mandell , joyce mcdonough , chris miller , karen mistry , becky moreton , cindy neuroth - gimbrone , steve seegmiller , mark seidenberg , barbara sensiba , dan slobin , leslie h . stennes , sherman wilcox , and the authors of the many messages that were forwarded to me from slling - l . - - bernard comrie dept of linguistics gfs-301 tel + 1 213 740 2986 university of southern california fax + 1 213 740 9306 los angeles , ca 90089-1693 , usa e-mail comrie @ bcf . usc . edu",Safe Email

"" the customers really appreciated the fact that we were there , providing a place for them to maintain and adjust their positions in the market . "" in a financial sense , enron ( ene ) didn ' t suffer , meyer said . but employees at the enron building in downtown houston were badly shaken . nick humber , who worked for enron ' s wind energy business , died aboard a los angeles bound flight that crashed into the world trade center . "" we have offices in washington and new york , and people who had friends that died or were affected in some way , "" meyer said "" we also had traders who were on the phone with people in the world trade center when the planes hit . "" the decision to temporarily halt commodity trading on the new york mercantile exchange in the wake of the attacks "" may have increased volatility , a boon to the group , "" said bob christensen , analyst at fac / equities . companies that can defray volatility by helping customers manage their energy costs should be seeing a lot of business , he said . managing risk is what enron does best , market players say . and that strength should help the company going forward as u . s . businesses try to recover from the impact of september 11 . through its enrononline platform , the company buys and sells commodities at volumes totaling about $ 3 billion a day , meyer said . "" the world at large has become more risk averse , and enron , which is in the business of risk mitigation , should benefit from that , "" said glen hilton , senior analyst and portfolio manager for the montgomery new power fund , which has a stake in enron . "" with energy risk and prices potentially going up , they ' ll be the first number on many cfos ' speed dial . "" other companies do what enron does , but it ' s the best positioned to succeed because of its status as the leader in natural gas and power trading , measured in terms of volume . duke energy ( duk ) is the next - largest competitor , but it has one - third of enron ' s volume . high profile departure that ' s a good place to be for a company whose stock price has been on the skids since last year , though it grew 151 percent on the top line in 2000 . other problems notwithstanding , including its money - losing broadband business and its failure to sell the oregon utility portland general electric , enron ' s largest black eye came in mid - august when jeffrey skilling , chief executive since february , resigned abruptly . john hammerschmidt , senior portfolio manager of the turner new energy and power technology fund , said he "" freaked out "" when skilling left and managers immediately divested the turner large - cap portfolios of enron holdings . despite its status as a growth player , turner had re - entered the stock in june after a long absence because of valuation . at the time , enron was trading in the mid to high $ 40 s . "" this is a premier company and a premier industry , "" he said , adding that he believed then that the market had priced rumors into the stock . one of the rumors was that enron was about to take a big loss from being long on power when power prices were collapsing , hammerschmidt said . that has not materialized . whatever the problems were , hammerschmidt said , he felt them to be manageable . when skilling walked out , hammerschmidt began to believe some of the rumors might be true . "" in our experience , when somebody in power leaves for no reason , there ' s uncertainty and uncertainty makes growth guys real nervous , "" he said . management continuity now he ' s looking to get back in . enron , he said , works in both down and up markets . "" enron ' s earnings are more solid today than they ' ve ever been . . . and they ' re valuable because we ' re becoming a digital economy , "" he said . "" we need high - quality power , and local power plants have trouble providing reliability . enron is focused on guaranteeing people quality power in times of stress on the system . "" of course there ' s still the issue about trusting management . after skilling left , enron promoted greg whalley to president and chief operating officer and mark frevert to vice chairman . "" you cannot expect ( whalley and frevert ) to articulate the enron vision the way jeffrey did , "" christensen said . "" they may grow into it . "" on the upside , skilling predecessor ken lay , who wall street credits with building enron into a powerhouse , is back at the helm , and he has promised to remain at the post until a solid succession plan is in place . "" we have a great deal of confidence in mr . ken lay as he was the original architect of ene ' s ( and for that matter the entire industry ' s ) tremendous transformation for the past decade , "" merrill lynch stated in a research report the day after skilling left enron . what ' s more : "" ken lay has promised more transparency at enron , more insight into how the company makes money , which will help , "" hilton said . "" trying to forecast enron ' s earnings is difficult . "" christensen said that a "" lack of data and clarity in regard "" to enron ' s wholesale operations has been an issue in the past . enron has promised to provide more information when it reports its third - quarter results on october 16 . ultimately , only time will assuage investors ' concerns . but with the prospects that enron has , the stock is a deal right now , hammerschmidt said .

"re : 5 . 1344 native speaker intuitions the discussion on native speaker intuitions has been extremely interesting , but i worry that my brief intervention may have muddied the waters . i take it that there are a number of separable issues . the first is the extent to which a native speaker is likely to judge a lexical string as grammatical or ungrammatical per se . the second is concerned with the relationships between syntax and interpretation ( although even here the distinction may not be entirely clear cut ) . most english speakers would probably judge child teacher the the asked leave to room the as both ungrammatical and uninterpretable . however , my couple of sentences ( which were from a source that i no longer recall - apologies ! ) raise slightly different issues . if it is possible to interpret the following : 1 . the child asked the teacher to leave the room 2 . the teacher asked the child to leave the room as having the same consequences ( i . e . that it was the child who left the room ) then it seems to me that the relationship between grammatical representation and interpretation is inherently unstable . just because some native speakers solve the problem in one way should not override the empirical fact that other native speakers solve it in another way . if we take the strings : 3 . i would ' ve done it . and the emphatice assertion : 4 . i really would have / of ( / ov / ) it would seem that , on the evidence of ( some ) british speakers ' phonologies , have = of . i . e . , they treat of as a verb in some circumstances . as prescriptivists , we can tell them that they are wrong , and explain ( by analogy ? ) why they are wrong . as descripivists , though , it seems that we have to take such native-speaker intuitions at their face value . in the latter case , we are left with a conundrum and one that seems to me particularly relevant to the problem of second language teaching : who is a native speaker ? for what it is worth , i have tried to explore these issues more detail in ' language and the linguists ' , _ social semiotics _ ( 1993 ) , 3 , 2 , 161-181 tony bex",Safe Email

out of the office has leaked! i think it would be best if we all
email the ""Systems Manager"" as a matter of urgency. in lieu of an
email address i suggest emailling all of postmaster, info, sales,
hostmaster, webmaster, support and accounts (and any other address
one can think of).now, considering the critical nature of this leak, if you do not 
receive an adequate reply i think one would be duty bound to raise 
the matter again, and again if needs be, until one gets a 
satisfactory reply.also, i notice a lot of people on this lot who post from company 
addresses do not have disclaimers on their emails. i would encourage 
everyone in a professional position to raise the matter of 
disclaimers internally and ensure that disclaimers are implemented 
for company emails, stationary and phone systems.finally, the email-disclaimers advocacy site 	http://www.emaildisclaimers.com/may prove to be a useful resource. rather strangely one of the quotes 
on the front-page of their site is:	'The disclaimers added to the end of emails are not legally 
	binding, but it's always good practice to try and disclaim liability'	-- Michael Chissick, Head of Internet law at Field Fisher 
	WaterhouseHowever, i suggest this quote, partly the initial part, be ignored
and that other more favourable quotes (by self-aggrandising
pundits^W^Wleading experts)  be heeded instead.  Also, there is a
vicious rumour going round that a year or so ago a rather large
company in the UK lost a court case where an employee sent out some
kind of libellous email or somesuch despite the company having
implemented email disclaimers. pay no heed to this - its just a
rumour (http://www.weblaw.co.uk/artemail.htm).Anyway, please: Email exel.com!!!> kevinNB: This email is copyright 2002 Paul Jakma. By reading this email

""The marine biologists and geologists believe they have shown life could have existed by processing methane without the presence of oxygen. ""Their findings could also prove useful in ridding the earth of excess methane, one of the greenhouse gases many scientists believe is responsible for global warming. ""Traditional views of early life on earth centre on plants which converted carbon dioxide to oxygen. ""'These (plant lifeforms) date back to between three and 3.5 billion years ago... We have found biomass (large cluster of organisms) using methane that geologists show could have existed around four billion years ago,' Professor Antje Boetius, joint author of the study, told Reuters.Link: Yes, she exists. Dr. Antje does more than exist. She gives some kinda publicity shot. Dang! http://www.mpi-bremen.de/deutsch/biogeo/aboetius/aboetius.html http://www.iu-bremen.de/directory/faculty/01063/ ""The two-year research by the scientists from Hamburg University, the Alfred Wegener Institute in northern Bremerhaven and the Max Planck Society centred on coral-forming micro-organisms in the Black Sea at depths where no oxygen and no light is present. ""The Black Sea contains the largest oxygen-free basin in the world. ""The lifeforms were able to process methane together with sulphates within the water, producing carbonates, in the form of coral, as waste. (((Black, oxygen-free ""coral"". I wonder what that stuff looks like. Maybe you could make jewelry out of it.))) ""That they were able to do so without oxygen suggests they may have been around before plant life. ""'Perhaps micro-organisms like those found in the Black Sea were the original inhabitants of the earth during a long period of the earth's history,' said Boetius. (((Yeah, they've just been sitting down there, waiting to save our bacon.))) ""She believes the findings could prove useful for climate control. ""Previously, scientists had thought that methane, found in abundance in the sea and produced through agriculture, could only be broken down with oxygen. ""The German researchers believe the discovery of a pool of organisms that process methane without oxygen could lead to a way of cutting down potentially harmful greenhouse gases without burning oxygen and producing similarly damaging carbon dioxide.

                              here falls shoe two         Well, it's getting late, and the government hasn't fallen,
         so we better roll the presses on the bad news. The CAMPAIGN
         FOR DIGITAL RIGHTS published its first in-depth analysis of
         the EUCD. For this exciting installment, CD-R has
         concentrated on what it does to people who have to
         circumvent copy protection to do their job. The short
         summary is: if they're not a teacher, a prison warder,
         disabled, or the cops, they can forget their jobs. If you're
         anyone else - like a musician, or a cryptographer -  and the
         copy protection says you can't make a backup, you can't. And
         even if you *are* a teacher or other exceptional person,
         you'll have to ask the Secretary of State if you can crack
         the protected CD. In writing. Each time.

                                     - oh, don't worry, it gets worse

                                   - what you can do to stop all this         But there's plenty more to ooze out of the law than that.
         One of the big questions about the EUCD is ""is it the
         European DMCA, or what?"". Well, the DMCA spurted bad juice
         in many different directions, but one way in which the two
         are similiar is over ""circumvention devices"". Distributing
         DeCSS, the DVD lobby have claimed, is a crime under the
         DMCA. DeCSS is code that was also a magically dangerous
         artifact: a circumvention device. Circumvention devices are
         about to become illegal here. Specifically, three months in
         chokey (or two years if you really nark the judge), for
         those who ""distribute otherwise than in the course of a
         business to such an extent as to affect prejudicially the
         copyright owner"" one of them. ""Otherwise in the course of
         business"" is legalese for ""as an ordinary punter"", so it's
         not just mod-chip sellers who are liable. Anyone who
         distributes such satanic machines is also a perp.

                                   - what you can do to stop all this         That's not going to go down well with ANDREW SIMMONS.
         Regular NTK readers will remember Andrew as a lightning rod
         to lawyers. Not only was he John Doe #13 in the American
         DeCSS case, but in a completely unrelated affair, he waws
         threatened with all manner of nastiness just for publishing
         his list of doomed dotcoms on his Website [NTK 2000-09-22].
         In the last week, he's had another letter via Demon, finally
         ordering him to remove his shiny ""circumvention device"" (aka
         DeCSS) from his site. It sounds like the lawyers may have
         shot their wad a tad early: the EUCD rules don't kick in
         until Christmas. But when the new laws do hit, and if what
         Andrew's preposterous correspondent says is believed in a UK
         court, hosting DeCSS *will* mean jail. There's been some
         talk about how the EUCD rules are better than the DMCA,
         because they specifically exclude computer programs from the
         new rules. Well, it looks like DeCSS is no longer just a
         computer program. From now on, it could become a special ""nick me""
         tag for your Website.

               sufficiently advanced technology : the gathering         The crazy counterintuitive conditional probability world of
         BAYES THEOREM has a reputation for making judges look stupid
         in DNA-testing murder cases, and search-engines look even
         stupider when they suggest ""relevant documents"" - but it's
         getting a bit of a re-renaissance in the spam filtering
         world. Tradition states Naive Bayesian alone doesn't work
         well enough at filtering by example, so it's good to see
         dozens of people independently sloshing around the noospere
         looking for better tweaked solutions. Including, of course,
         leading noosphere cadet ERIC S RAYMOND, whose Bayesian
         BOGOFILTER is fast, has extra smarts, and is up to version
         0.2. Unfortunately, as with Raymond's abandoned kernel
         configurator and recent anti-gay anti-islam anti-vegetable
         rants, it requires taking on board just a *bit* too
         much extra baggage to really take off. Rennies' IFILE around
         has been around for a while, and has support for MH and
         mutt. Gary Arnold's BAYESPAM is something he knocked up in
         Perl for qmail; a good start if you want to try this
         yourself. Which you should, because nobody's cracked it yet.

*Q AND A SECTION**SHIVER MY TIMBERS*/From Tad Spencer/: ""Please could you tell me where the phrase /shiver 
my timbers/ originated?""This is one of those supposedly nautical expressions that seem to be 
better known through a couple of appearances in fiction than by any 
actual sailors' usage.It's an exclamation that may allude to a ship striking some rock or 
other obstacle so hard that her timbers shiver, or shake, so implying a 
calamity has occurred. It is first recorded as being used by Captain 
Frederick Marryat in /Jacob Faithful/ in 1835: ""I won't thrash you Tom. 
Shiver my timbers if I do"".It has gained a firm place in the language because almost fifty years 
later Robert Louis Stevenson found it to be just the kind of old-salt 
saying that fitted the character of Long John Silver in /Treasure 
Island/: ""Cross me, and you'll go where many a good man's gone before 
you ... some to the yard-arm, shiver my timbers, and some by the board, 
and all to feed the fishes"". Since then, it's mainly been the preserve 
of second-rate seafaring yarns.",Safe Email

( i want to note that i have identified 209 ( = 13 % ) causal since-clauses among 1576 causal as - , because - , for - and since-clauses in the machine readable british - english lob - corpus ( written texts from 1961 ) . most of these since-clauses are to be found in the category called ' learned and scientific writing ' . ) another informant , for whom my example sentence ( 1 ) is essentially synonymous with either conjunction , has the impression that the speaker of ( 1 ) using ' because ' "" feels john 's admission more noteworthy , or more important to the narrative , than he or she would if 's ince ' or ' as ' were used . "" into the same direction , i assume , goes another judgement according to which ' because ' is "" stronger and more explicit and more exceptional . "" ( i have found a similar view in the literature and have interpreted it as a consequence of my differentiation : entailment on the basis of a rule or norm is intrinsically less noteworthy , less exceptional than ' real ' causation . ) some people have pointed out the relevance of the position of the causal clause . as a tendency , my rule / norm interpretation is considered to be more in accordance with the causal clause ( be it 's ince / as ' or ' because ' ) preceding its main / matrix clause . however , one informant feels "" more comfortable with since clauses preceding , and because clauses following , the main clause . "" ( this impression is somehow in conformity with the statistical situation in the above mentioned lob - corpus : only about 9 % of the because-clauses are preposed , whereas 41 % of the since-clauses and 43 % of the as-clauses are preposed there . ) one informant pointed out constraints which may affect the acceptability of 's ince ' as a causal conjunction : "" 's ince ' seems to have a much more limited application . for me there is a tense / aspect / ? ? ? constraint between the clauses ( consistent with the temporal meaning it also has ? ? ) , otherwise it sounds forced or stilted . i do n't really like your sentence ( 1 ) with 's ince ' . reversing the clauses makes it more acceptable to me , as does changing ' was ' to ' is ' ( strange ! ) . conversely , changing ' has been ' to ' was ' makes the 's ince ' version even less acceptable to me . "" ( probably , the last point in this quotation is caused by the fact that replacement of ' was ' by ' has been ' makes the sentence grammatically acceptable with a temporal interpretation of the since-clause . ) do i have to conclude from the ' empirical ' outcome of my query that my differentiation is not tenable ? for various reasons ( which i hope to develop convincingly in a doctoral dissertation to be submitted soon ) , i do not think so . are there , perhaps , some more people ' out there ' who agree with my claims , but who refrain from simply stating ' i agree ' ? of course , this would not make my query statistically more valid , but it would suggest that there is some plausibility to my non-empirical reasons . carsten breul e-mail : carsten . breul @ rz . ruhr-uni - bochum . de",Safe Email

America, I'm glad you asked. Before I go on please be warned, 
this explanation may not sit well with many of you, however it is 
no less true! ""Ghetto"" America is a society of individuals 
comprised primarily of African Americans who represent the 
impoverished, and often unpolished side of ""Black America;"" 
Confused?! I shall explain further; have you ever passed by a 
typical ghetto community; namely the ""projects"" and noticed an 
unusual amount of fancy cars parked throughout that particular 
neighborhood, and wondered how could that be? Or maybe you have 
been to a shopping mall, and noticed an unusual amount of young 
""teen looking"" black women carrying infants, or pushing baby 
carriages and often with a toddler in tow! Perhaps you also 
noticed that there was rarely any male companion accompanying 
them. If you paid close attention you might have also noticed the 
absence of the all important ""wedding band"" missing from their 
respective ring fingers!"" .And of course we have all heard 
stories of young black men carrying guns, and knives, allegedly 
mugging, robbing and carjacking people of all sorts! Did you know 
that many young African American women refuse to date African 
American males if they do not own or possess an automobile. In 
fact many young Black women prefer only to date individuals who 
represent the subversive side of society; commonly known as 
""Thugs"" or ""Street Hustlers;"" Also, did you know that many young 
African American males prefer to buy expensive luxury cars while 
living in government housing better known as the ""projects"" 
rather than move away, purchase new homes, save, or even make 
investments?
 
    ""Attention"" This is Not another ""Boyz in the Hood"" Story!
 
These newly distinguished ""Black Generation Xers"" are suffering 
through utter chaos. ""Baby Makers, Loser choosers, Welfare 
Abusers...Images of My America"" is a collection of observations, 
and commentary as told through the eyes of a young African 
American Male who experienced, and perpetuated many of the truths 
that many in ""Black America,"" and the world in general would have 
you believe do not exist. It is a riveting expose that sheds 
light on the oppressive, and often discriminatory nature of 
""Mainstream American Society."" A society that has nurtured the 
rampant disregards for self-respect, and enlightenment that many 
young African American men, and women currently suffer from. The 
writer supports his arguments with direct references to the 
overwhelming numbers of young black single mothers attempting to 
raise children, with many being teens themselves; and the foolish 
criteria that is utilized when choosing their mates; oftentimes 
being based on nothing more than the young black male's tough or 
cool neighborhood reputation.
 
The author also identifies the self-destructive and often 
criminal behavior that many young black men perpetuate on a daily 
basis like, refusing to pursue higher education, carrying guns, 
robbing, stealing, selling drugs, driving fancy cars, and wearing 
expensive jewelry. The negative and self-debasing behavior 
committed by both males, and females is due in large part to a 
lack of guidance resulting from having been reared in fatherless 
homes. These poor choices, and behavioral disorders coupled with 
the unnecessary burden that it places on tax paying citizens in 
the form of welfare abuse, and over crowded prison populations 
are the center causes for the cycle of rampant poverty, and lack 
of direction that currently exists in young ""Black America"" 
today. To learn more about this dynamic self contained society

"2nd call for papers : dgfs meeting 1998 call for papers as part of the annual meeting of the german linguistic society ( deutsche gesellschaft fuer sprachwissenschaft ) , to be held in halle ( saale ) , germany , march 4 - 6 1998 , there will be a workshop ( arbeitsgruppe ) on the following topic : the role of functional categories in language contact and change in current syntactic theory functional categories play an important role in determining the structure of clauses and noun phrases . while in ` regular ' language change the content of functional categories seems to be relatively stable , in many language contact situations , e . g . creolization , code-switching , functional categories are lost and , subsequently , reconstituted . a major issue hereby is on which grammatical knowledge speakers model the reconstitution of these elements . some of the specific questions to be adressed in this session are : ( i ) which functional categories are necessarily reconstituted , and which are not ? this relates to the issues of universality ( or ug - compatibility ) and markedness of functional categories ; ( ii ) what type of functional categories are reconstituted : those that contribute to meaning ( lf - interpretable ) , or those that only convey grammatical information , or both ? ; ( iii ) which lexical categories are used as a model for reconstitution and , consequently , are reinterpreted as functional categories ? ; ( iv ) from which language ( s ) in the contact situation are the ( lexical or grammatical ) elements drawn used for reconstitution of functional categories ? papers will are relevant to this topic are invited . papers should take 30 minutes , to be followed by 15 minutes of discussion . a one-page abstract should be sent ( preferably by e-mail ) to the organizer ( address below ) by september 1 , 1997 . dr . t . veenstra instituut voor algemene taalwetenschap universiteit van amsterdam spuistraat 210 nl-1012 vt amsterdam tel 00 . 31 . 20 . 525 . 3858 fax 00 . 31 . 20 . 525 . 3021 e-mail t . veenstra @ let . uva . nl",Safe Email

( http : / / www . mri . mq . edu . au / ~ mariam / flexht / ) - intelligent educational systems on the world - wide web , held in conjunction with the 8th world conference on artificial intelligence in education ( ai-ed97 ) . ( http : / / www . contrib . andrew . cmu . edu / ~ plb / aied97 _ workshop / ) - workshop on adaptive systems and user modeling on the world wide web , held in conjunction with the sixth international conference on user modeling ( um ' 97 ) .

( http : / / www . cs . su . oz . au / ~ bob / um96 - workshop . html ) - workshop on adaptive hypertext and hypermedia held in conjunction with the fourth international conference on user modeling ( um ' 94 ) . ( http : / / www . education . uts . edu . au / projects / ah / ah-94 . html ) more information about adaptive hypertext systems can be found at http : / / www . education . uts . edu . au / projects / ah / workshop focus : there has been a significant amount of research in this area over the past five years ( see workshop theme for more information ) , but two recurring issues have become increasingly important , and these will be the focus of this workshop : - standards : with the increasing popularity of the world wide web and the growing market for flexible document delivery systems , we need to develop standards for these systems in order to encourage and facilitate their use more widely on the world wide web . in order to develop such standards it is first important to more clearly define the requirements for such systems : what does it mean for a system to be a flexible , adaptive or dynamic hypertext system ? following on from these requirements , which techniques are important in flexible hypertext systems ? finally , can we design a standard architecture for flexible hypertext systems which can be re-used widely ? - evaluation : one of the key issues which arose from the first flexible hypertext workshop and which has been aired again recently on the adaptive hypertext mailing list is the importance of the evaluation of flexible hypertext systems . in particular , since the main goal of these systems is to maximise the suitability of a document to the user 's knowledge and needs , evaluation is an essential aspect in the development of these systems . however , very little research has been done which confirms the advantages of such systems or which demonstrates how this might be done . workshop format : the workshop will run for one full day on 14 april . the number of attendees will be limited to 20 in order to encourage participation in workshop discussions . participation will be on the basis of submitted position papers or by invitation . the workshop will include a limited number of paper presentations and general group discussions . group discussions will focus on the issues raised in the position papers , as well as on some focus questions . a workshop dinner will also be organised to encourage informal discussion . the programme will include : welcome and introduction workshop sessions consisting of : 1 to 2 position paper presentations ( 15-30 minutes ) , and group discussion on the issues raised ( 30-60 minutes ) closing : planning for post-workshop activities conclusions and wrap - up workshop dinner the proceedings will be compiled into a technical report after the workshop . position papers : we invite position papers describing demonstrated techniques for improving the flexibility of hypertext documents . we are particularly interested in papers which present innovative solutions to providing flexible hypertext documents , and those which address the need for building standard architectures and evaluation techniques for such systems . we are also interested in receiving papers assessing the benefits and downfalls of providing flexible documents , and papers of a more speculative nature which focus on the future of flexible hypertext systems . those aspects of the paper which are important for discussion in the workshop should be clearly outlined in the paper . papers should be 3 - 5 pages long , and should be put up on the web . if you do n't have access to a web server , then some space will be allocated for you . electronic submission of the url address of the position paper will be preferred , although papers submitted as ascii ( html ) or postscript will be accepted . to submit a position paper , send the url address and an ascii version of the paper itself to : mariam @ mpce . mq . edu . au if this is not possible , please send hard copies to : maria milosavljevic csiro mathematical and information sciences locked bag 17 north ryde nsw 2113 australia important dates : 27 february 1998 : submission of position papers 13 march 1998 : notification of acceptance or rejection 27 march 1998 : camera - ready copies due before the workshop , all attendees will be able to access the position papers from the web . we strongly encourage attendees to read these before the workshop . programme committee : maria milosavljevic ( chair ) , macquarie university , australia . peter brusilovsky , carnegie mellon university , usa . robert dale , macquarie university , australia . paul de bra , eindhoven university of technology , the netherlands . kristina hook , swedish institute of computer science , sweden . judy kay , university of sydney , australia . jon oberlander , university of edinburgh , scotland . cecile paris , csiro mathematical and information sciences , australia . julita vassileva , university of saskatchewan , canada for more information : - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - maria milosavljevic mri language technology group macquarie university sydney nsw 2113 australia email : mariam @ mpce . mq . edu . au tel : ( + 61 2 ) 9850 6345 fax : ( + 61 2 ) 9850 9529",Safe Email

"yeh one more thing. None of this would explain why the signatures for sample-spam.txt from spamassassin is registered on honor but not apt or fire.-----Original Message----- From: Rose, Bobby Sent: Thursday, August 08, 2002 9:54 AM To: mail@vipul.net; razor-users@example.sourceforge.net Subject: RE: [Razor-users] What's wrong with the Razor servers now? Thanks that helps. There's still so little info on TES and those of us here since RazorV1 know how it works. I did set my min_cf to ""ac-100"" which I thought would be zero. So the way you are suggesting that it works now is that everyone has a trust level of 1 and have to work their way up. Your trust level increases when someone nominates the same message as spam. This must have been the new changes made at the beginning of the week unless the changes dumped everyone's trust level. Now here come the questions...What engine signature does TES look at? Does it have to be the same e1 signature or does it use the e2 or e4 signatures. How many people have to nominate the message before everyones rating increases? How many revokes decreases someones rating? Does a single revoke decrease the rating of everyone that nominated the message? If a newby reports a message that has already been reported does their trust level immediately go up? In the case of revoking, does someone with a trust level of 1 have the capability to revoke a message submitted by multiple people with higher trust levels? -----Original Message----- From: Vipul Ved Prakash [mailto:mail@vipul.net] Sent: Thursday, August 08, 2002 4:22 AM To: razor-users@example.sourceforge.net Subject: Re: [Razor-users] What's wrong with the Razor servers now? Bobby, Couple of things: If you are not a trusted reporter, your reports will not have an immediate effect. It takes a bunch of trusted reporters to bump up the confidence of a signature to a point where it is considered to be spam. This might be frustrating initially, but as the number of trusted users grows the time delay between nominations and determination will become shorter. Of course, it's a lot more frustating for people to have their legit mail filtered out due to incorrect reporting.Also, for the purpose of testing, I'd suggest making your min_cf (in razor-agents.conf) to 0. min_cf defaults to the server recommended average confidence, which at the moment is 1. Setting min_cf to 0 should return true for whatever you submit (as long as it was not revoked by a trusted user).apt/fire sync with honor every 5 minutes, so you'd have to wait for a _maximum_ of 5 minutes before signatures propagate.cheers, vipul.

the uncontrollable forest fires were the result of the Forest Service's
long-standing ""10:00 A.M. policy"", in place until the decision in 1963 to
switch over to ""let-it-burn"".The 10:00 A.M. policy was based on theories about forest management from
Europe, and wasn't as applicable to the American wilds. So, we went from a
policy of containment for 100 years to one of letting things burn unless they
directly threatened property.40 years after the end of the containment policy there is still a lot of stuff
left to burn. I can't imagine that artificially planted replacement
forests, with dense stands of identical trees, help that much either. I would be comfortable laying the fault for these contributing factors
squarely with the Forest Service. I would put the blame for many burned homes
upon the people who chose to build their dwelling with an unwise combination of
materials, location, and landscaping.--

"transportation as a commodity . - - - - - original message - - - - - from : djcustomclips @ djinteractive . com [ mailto : djcustomclips @ djinteractive . com ] sent : tuesday , september 18 , 2001 10 : 43 pm to : 168842 @ mailman . enron . com subject : rahil jafry : transportation as a commodity . transportation as a commodity . by bill hensel jr . 09 / 10 / 2001 joc week copyright ( c ) 2001 . the journal of commerce inc . all rights reserved . enron corp . , the houston - based energy giant , is familiar with commodity markets . in addition to energy , the business for which it is best known , enron is the world ' s largest metals trader . the company also understands transportation . it ships products as diverse as coal , steel , forest products and project cargo . now enron is proposing to change the face of over - the - road trucking and domestic intermodal services , by treating them as a commodity that can be bought and sold like any other product . the company ' s enron freight markets unit promises to help shippers and carriers manage risks associated with fluctuating diesel fuel prices and other shipping costs . enron will quote a set rate for dock - to - dock moves , and guarantee the service promised in the contract . enron freight markets was created in march to develop a market for freight capacity and to buy and sell spot and forward capacity in transportation . as in other futures markets such as soybeans or pork bellies , a buyer of a contract would have the option of taking delivery of the service or closing out his position . enron has successfully used similar formulas to create markets in energy . can it do the same with trucking and intermodal freight capacity ? barry par - ker , a consultant for bdpl consulting ltd . , which specializes in freight economics , said it could work but that transportation isn ' t like other markets . "" the marketplace needs these things , but transportation marketplaces are not really receptive to them , "" parker said . "" i applaud what they are doing , but it is an uphill battle . "" enron took a first step up that hill this year with its acquisition of webmodal , a firm that provides domestic intermodal technology and logistics services for carriers , shippers and service providers . the former webmodal office in chicago houses enron freight ' s 24 - hour customer service and operations center . this summer , enron took another step , by acquiring trucking capacity for up to two years with major trucking companies . enron said it recently signed its first firm sales contract with a major shipper , but declined to identify it . dan reck , vice president of enron freight markets , said the company can offer shippers and carriers performance obligation terms that are considerably different from any others . "" what enron freight markets is trying to do is commercialize the risk management products for the freight market , "" reck said . a key to the service is standardization of general contractual terms and conditions . the standardized areas would include specific delivery times , and specific consequences for non - performance . fixed - price contracts act to stabilize fuel surcharges , spikes in shipping volumes and fluctuating carrier rates . enron said it can do that not only because it has deep pockets to make the market liquid , but also by using its technology to evaluate optimal routing and modes and by having customers sign long - term contracts . "" what ends up happening is that the obligations of both parties be - comes much more clean and predictable , "" reck said . "" so from a carrier ' s perspective , they can really count on a revenue stream from this piece of their business . there are very clean operational parameters . we are also trying to have shippers sign on with us under those same terms and conditions . "" enron has a reputation as an innovator in its approach to the natural gas and electric - power markets , and is trying to change the way other markets , such as steel , are structured . efm sees transportation as another commodity with a price that can be the basis of hedging or speculation . "" we are kind of commodity - agnostic , "" reck explained . "" we don ' t care what the commodity is , we just sell capacity . "" enron ' s approach differs significantly from others that have entered the trucking field as technology - based intermediaries . nte , the former national transportation exchange , puts buyers and sellers directly together , while logistics . com uses the contracting process to identify the most cost - effective matches between shippers and carriers . unlike the online services , enron contracts directly with the party involved and does not wait for two to be matched up on its website . under enron ' s ideal contract , damages for non - performance are spelled out explicitly as part of its belief that for the market to work buyers must be able to bank on the reliability of the contract . for example , suppose a carrier has accepted a contract price of $ 1 . 20 per mile for a shipment of freight between atlanta and chicago . if enron does not provide the carrier with a load and the next best alternative the carrier can find is 70 cents per mile , enron pays the difference . the same process would work in reverse . if the carrier promised to provide a truck and didn ' t , enron would provide a replacement at a higher price and the trucker would have to make up the difference . reck said the standardized contract would not be dictated by enron but would evolve through negotiations or public forums . efforts are under way to introduce the company to shippers , carriers and other intermediaries . enron officials say they ' ve talked with 400 to 500 shippers since march . one goal is to persuade an independent group - such as a trucking association or committee of marketplace participants - to sponsor a forum for negotiations , which the company believes would add legitimacy . in its first contract , enron is acting as a carrier , since the shipper already was working with a third - party logistics provider . enron considers itself distinct from 3 pls . it focuses on dock - to - dock moves and leaves supply - chain optimization to others . its aim is to allow parties to minimize risk , for example by giving shippers the ability to hedge against the possibility of diesel pass - through fees . enron is an extensive user of the internet , however , and last year launched enrononline for traders to trade natural gas , oil , electricity and various other commodities online . no one expects enron ' s new freight capacity product to capture immediate acceptance . even enron acknowledges that acceptance will be slow . reck said it will take time to overcome cultural resistance to change in the freight industry , and that enron is prepared for that . "" we have done that in every market we have gotten into , "" reck said . "" what we find is the economic benefits of doing business this way overpowers resistance over time . you have to show what the benefits are . "" jocoo 000 .

"davis appoints cpuc commissioner gov . davis announced today his appointment of mike peevey as commissioner at the cpuc to replace com . bilas who resigned last week . mr . peevey is the former president of southern california edison and as such advocated deregulation . consumer group advocates are concerned about his past record and oppose his nomination which is subject to state senate approval . below is an article from the sacramento bee . gh davis names ex - edison chief to puc but the action stirs anger : ' our worst nightmare , ' says a consumer lawyer . by stuart leavenworth - - bee staff writer published 5 : 30 a . m . pst wednesday , march 6 , 2002 gov . gray davis has appointed a former president of southern california edison to a state panel charged with regulating edison and other public utilities . davis said michael r . peevey would bring "" more than three decades of experience "" to the public utilities commission - - experience that immediately came under fire from the state ' s consumer groups . mike florio , a lawyer for the utility reform network , said peevey has a record , both in government and in business , of pushing for higher rates for small businesses and residential consumers . "" this is a our worst nightmare , "" florio said . "" it is like putting dr . kevorkian in charge of a nursing home . "" others were more supportive . d . j . smith , a lobbyist who represents large industrial energy users , lauded peevey as someone "" who understands all sides of the energy business "" and will be fair to all sides . "" i think he will be objective about edison because he doesn ' t owe edison anything , "" said smith , noting that peevey left the southern california utility nine years ago . the husband of assemblywoman carol liu , d - south pasadena , peevey replaces puc commissioner richard bilas , who resigned last week . bilas was appointed by gov . pete wilson . if confirmed by the state senate , peevey will solidify davis ' control over the puc , a five - member board that now includes three of the governor ' s appointees . it also comes at a time when the commission is fighting with the state ' s other large utility , pacific gas and electric co . , on terms for pg & e ' s reorganization in federal bankruptcy court . pg & e spokesman ron low declined to comment on the appointment tuesday , but last year peevey was involved with a handshake deal that might have helped pg & e avoid bankruptcy . hired by davis to negotiate with the utility , peevey reportedly struck a deal with pg & e chairman bob glynn that would have let pg & e charge ratepayers for all its costs of buying wholesale electricity . but other davis advisers objected to the deal and the negotiations ultimately fell apart . for three years , peevey was president of edison international and southern california edison before leaving in 1993 in a reported power struggle with company chairman john bryson . peevey then became a public affairs consultant and then president of newenergy inc . , an energy service provider that was sold in 1999 to aes corp . after working as an adviser to davis , he had been ceo of truepricing inc . and also has served on the board of excelergy corp . , an energy software company . with his new six - year puc job , peevey will regulate not only electric utilities but telecommunications giants , water companies , natural gas supplies and other industries . after a review by puc lawyers , peevey will have to divest holdings and resign from positions that could cause a conflict , davis spokesman steve maviglio said . peevy ' s appointment was one of two davis made tuesday . he also appointed john l . geesman to the board of the independent system operator , which manages most of the state power grid . since 1985 , geesman has been the managing director of fixed income banking for rbc dain rauscher inc . in san francisco . he once served on turn ' s board . consumer groups , which had pressed for a meeting with davis for the past week , said the he may have timed his election day appointment of peevey to minimize negative media coverage . maviglio called that claim "" ludicrous .

I'm having trouble getting SA working like I understand it should work,

tell the program to take no action at all against any mail coming in from
yahoogroups.com, or is there still checking being done against it?  And if
the latter, what does he need to place in user_prefs to cause such mail

"new uci dissertation in linguistics irvine linguistics students association is pleased to announce the publication of the following uci dissertation in linguistics . overt movement as a reflex of morphology hajime ikawa under the framework of the minimalist program , this thesis answers fundamental questions with overt movement such as ( i ) what forces its application , and ( ii ) what is responsible for its presence / absence in languages . chapter 1 raises the above-mentioned fundamental questions with overt movement . it is shown that the current minimalist framework , as it is , does not explain any of them in a principled way . chapter 2 introduces two major operations assumed by the minimalist program , merge and move . chapter 3 first undertakes to identify the cause of overt movement in a way consistent with the basic minimalist assumption that any application of overt movement , as a departure from the best case , should be forced from the outside of the core computational system . it is claimed that overt movement is directly driven by the module morphology , which applies right after spell - out ; overt movement , whether head-movement or xp - movement , is forced to apply to morphologically support the suffixal functional heads . this claim automatically leads to derive the absence of overt movement in consistently head-final languages like japanese from their word order . the proposed analysis not only provides principled answers for the fundamental questions with overt movement , but eliminates one of the most problematic aspects of the minimalist program , the strong / weak distinction among functional heads . chapter 4 discusses various implications and consequences of the proposed analysis for overt movement , phrase structure , the computational system , and typological variations . chapter 5 discusses overt np - raising as overt movement indirectly driven by the morphological properties of agr . it is claimed that a subject in nominative-accusative languages overtly raises not to directly support agr , but to provide f-features for agr so that it can be successfully suffixed to a verb as the overt realization of the f-features of an np . from this , asymmetries between overt np - raising and other overt movements directly driven by morphology naturally follow . also available : > uci dissertations in linguistics griffith , teresa a . 1996 projecting transitivity and agreement takano , yuji 1996 movement and parametric variation in syntax zoerner , cyril edward 1995 coordination : the syntax of &p us $ 14 each , plus shipping and handling > uci working papers in linguistics , volume 3 ( 1997 ) . edited by luther > chen - sheng liu and kazue takeda articles appearing in the third volume are : brian agbayani : category raising , adjunction , and minimality lisa lai - shen cheng : "" partial "" wh - movement naoki fukui : attract and the a - over - a principle toru ishii : the "" crossing "" constraint and the minimal link condition luther chen - sheng liu : light verb and accusative - ing gerund in taiwanese yuji takano : object shift as short scrambling kazue takeda : a note on locality of category movement and feature movement sze - wing tang : the parametric approach to the resultative construction in chinese and english miyoko yashui : identification of ellipses and other empty categories us $ 14 , plus shipping and handling > uci working papers in linguistics , volume 2 : proceedings of the south > western optimality theory workshop ( swot ii ) . edited by brian agbayani > and naomi harada us $ 12 , plus shipping and handling > uci working papers in linguistics , volume 1 . edited by brian agbayani , > kazue takeda and sze - wing tang us $ 12 , plus shipping and handling shipping and handling ( per item ) domestic : $ 5 ;

"" the enclosed information is something i almost slip through my fingers . fortunately , sometime later i re-read everything and gave some thought and study to it . my name is johnathon rourke . two years ago , the corporation i worked at for the past twelve years down-sized and my position was eliminated . after unproductive job interviews , i decided to open my own business . over the past year , i incurred many unforeseen financial problems . i owed my family , friends and creditors over $ 35 , 000 . the economy was taking a toll on my business and i just could n't seem to make ends meet . i had to refinance and borrow against my home to support my family and struggling business . at that moment something significant happened in my life and i am writing to share the experience in hopes that this will change your life forever financially ! ! ! in mid december , i received this program via e-mail . six month 's prior to receiving this program i had been sending away for information on various business opportunities . all of the programs i received , in my opinion , were not cost effective . they were either too difficult for me to comprehend or the initial investment was too much for me to risk to see if they would work or not . one claimed that i would make a million dollars in one year , it did n't tell me i 'd have to write a book to make it ! but like i was saying , in december of 1997 1 received this program . i did n't send for it , or ask for it , they just got my name off a mailing list . thank goodness for that ! ! ! after reading it several times , to make sure i was reading it correctly , i could n't believe my eyes . here was a money making phenomenon . i could invest as much as i wanted to start , without putting me further into debt . after i got a pencil and paper and figured it out , i would at least get my money back . but like most of you i was still a little skeptical and a little worried about the legal aspects of it all . so i checked it out with the u . s . post office ( 1-800 - 725-2161 24 - hrs ) and they confirmed that it is indeed legal ! after determining the program was legal and not a chain letter , i decided "" why not . "" initially i sent out 10 , 000 e-mails . it cost me about $ 15 for my time on-line . the great thing about e-mail is that i do n't need any money for printing to send out the program , and because all of my orders are fulfilled via e-mail , my only expense is my time . i am telling you like it is , i hope it does n't turn you off , but i promised myself that i would not "" rip-off "" anyone , no matter how much money it cost me . in less than one week , i was starting to receive orders for report # 1 . by january 13 , 1 had received 26 orders for report # 1 . your goal is to "" receive at least 20 orders for report # 1 within 2 weeks . if you don ' t , send out more programs until you do !

"" the traditional methods of making money will never allow you to "" move up "" or "" get rich "" , inflation will see to that . you have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life , with "" no risk "" and "" just a little bit of effort . "" you can make more money in the next few months than you have ever imagined . i should also point out that i will not see a penny of this money , nor anyone else who has provided a testimonial for this program . i have already made over 4 million dollars ! i have retired from the program after sending thousands and thousands of programs . follow the program exactly as instructed . do not change it in any way . it works exceedingly well as it is now . remember to e - mail a copy of this exciting report to everyone you can think of . one of the people you send this to may send out 50 , 000 and your name will be on everyone of them ! remember though , the more you send out the more potential customers you will reach . so my friend , i have given you the ideas , information , materials and opportunity to become financially independent , it is up to you now ! "" think about it "" before you delete this program from your mailbox , as i almost did , take a little time to read it and really think a-bout it . get a pencil and figure out what could happen when you participate . figure out the worst possible response and no matter how you calculate it , you will still make a lot of money ! you will definitely get back what you invested . any doubts you have will vanish when your first orders come in . it works ! jody jacobs , richmond , va here ' s how this amazing program will make you thousands of dollar $ instructions : this method of raising capital really works 100 % every time . i am sure that you could use up to $ 50 , 000 or more in the next 90 days . before you say "" bull "" , please read this program carefully . this is not a chain letter , but a perfectly legal money making opportunity . basically , this is what you do : as with all multi-level businesses , we build our business by recruiting new partners and selling our products . every state in the usa allows you to recruit new multi-level business partners , and we offer a product for every dollar sent . your orders come by mail and are filled by e-mail , so you are not involved in personal selling . you do it privately in your own home , store or office . this is the greatest multi - level mail order marketing anywhere : this is what you must do : 1 . order all 4 reports shown on the list below ( you can't sell them if you do n't order them ) . * for each report , send $ 5 . 00 cash , the name & number of the report you are ordering , your e-mail address , and your name & return address ( in case of a problem ) to the person whose name appears on the list next to the report . make sure your return address is on your envelope in case of any mail problems ! * when you place your order , make sure you order each of the four reports . you will need all four reports so that you can save them on your computer and resell them . * within a few days you will receive , via e-mail , each of the four reports . save them on your computer so they will be accessible for you to send to the 1 , 000 's of people who will order them from you . 2 . important - - do not alter the names of the people who are listed next to each report , or their seqience on the list , in any way other than is instructed below in steps "" a "" through "" f "" or you will lose out on the majority of your profits . once you understand the way this works , you ' ll also see how it does n't work if you change it . remember , this method has been tested , and if you alter it , it will not work . a . look below for the listing of available reports . b . after you ' ve ordered the four reports , take this advertisement and remove the name and address under report # 4 . this person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their $ 50 , 000 !

3 . take this entire letter , including the modified list of names , and save it to your computer . make no changes to the instruction portion of this letter . your cost to participate in this is practically nothing ( surely you can afford $ 20 ) . you obviously already have an internet connection and e - mail is free ! there are two primary methods of building your downline : method # 1 : sending bulk e-mail let 's say that you decide to start small , just to see how it goes and we ' ll assume you and all those involved send out only 2 , 000 programs each . let 's also assume that the mailing receives a 0 . 5 % response . using a good list the response could be much better . also , many people will send out hundreds of thousands of programs instead of 2 , 000 . but continuing with this example , you send out only 2 , 000 programs . with a 0 . 5 % response , that is only 10 orders for report # 1 . those 10 people respond by sending out 2 , 000 programs each for a total of 20 , 000 . out of those 0 . 5 % , 100 people respond and order report # 2 . those 100 mail out 2 , 000 programs each for a total of 200 , 000 . the 0 . 5 % response to that is 1 , 000 orders for report # 3 . those 1 , 000 send out 2 , 000 programs each for a 2 , 000 , 000 total . the 0 . 5 % response to that is 10 , 000 orders for report # 4 . that 's 10 , 000 $ 5 bills for you . cash ! ! ! your total income in this example is $ 50 + $ 500 + $ 5 , 000 + $ 50 , 000 for a total of $ 55 , 550 ! ! ! remember friend , this is assuming 1 , 99q out of the 2 , 000 people you mail to will do absolutely nothing and trash this program ! dare to think for a moment what would hpppen if everyone , or half sent out 100 , 000 programs instead of 2 , 000 . believe me , many people will do just that , and more ! by the way , your cost to participate in this is practically nothing . you obviously already have an internet connection and e-mail is free ! ! ! report # 2 will show you the best methods for bulk e-mailing , tell you where to obtain free bulk e-mail software and where to obtain e - mail lists . method # 2 - placing free ads on the internet advertising on the ' net is very , very inexpensive , and there are hundreds of free places to advertise . let 's say you decide to start small just to see how well it works . assume your goal is to get only 10 people to participate on your first level . ( placing a lot of free ads on the internet will easily get a larger response . ) assuming that everyone else in your organization gets only 10 downline members . follow this example to achieve the staggering results below . ist level - - your 10 members with $ 5 - - $ 50 2nd level - - 10 members from those 10 ( $ 5 x 100 ) $ 500 3rd level - - 10 members from those 100 ( $ 5 x 1 , 000 ) $ 5 , 000 4th level - - 10 members from those 1 , 000 ( $ 5 x 10 , 000 ) . $ 50 , 000 this totals - - - - - - - - - - - - $ 55 , 550 remember friends , this assumes that the people who participate only recruit 10 people each . think for a moment what would happen if they got 20 people to participate ! most people get 100 's of participants ! think about it ! for every $ 5 . 00 you receive , all you must dc , is e-mail them the report they ordered . that ' s it ! always provide same-day service on all orders ! this will guarantee that the e-mail they send out , with your name and address on it , will be prompt because they can't advertise until they receive the report ! available reports * * * order each report by number and name - 1 - - * * notes : - always send $ 5 cash ( u . s . currency ) for each report cheques not accepted - always send your order via first class mail - make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least two sheets of paper . on one of those sheets of paper , include : ( a ) the number & name of the report you are ordering , ( b ) your e-mail address , and ( c ) your name & postal address . place your order for these reports now : report # 1 "" the insider 's guide to advertising for free on the internet "" order report # 1 from : crossroads enterprises 5507-10 nesconset hwy . # 317 mt . siani , ny . 11766 report # 2 "" the insider 's guide to sending bulk e - mail on the internet "" order report # 2 from : laura waite rfd1 box 798 campton , nh . 03223 report # 3 "" the secrets to multilevel marketing on the internet "" order report 43 from : philip webster 1011 second st . port orange , fl . 32119 report # 4 "" how to become a millionaire utilizing the power of multilevel marketing and the internet "" order report # 4 from : patricia arnold 174 windward ct . s . port jefferson , ny . 11777 about 50 , 000 new people get online every month ! * * * * * * * tips for success * * * * * * * * * * treat this as your business ! be prompt , professional , and follow the directions accurately . * * * send for the four reports immediately so you will have them when the orders start coming in because : when you receive a $ 5 order , you must send out the requested product / report . always provide same-day service on the orders you receive . be patient and persistent with this program . if you follow the instructions exactly , your results will be successful ! above all , have faith in yourself and know you wilt , succeed ! * * * * * * * your success guidelines * * * * * * * follow these guidelines to guarantee your success : if you do n't receive 20 orders for report # 1 within two weeks , continue advertising or sending e-mails until you do . then , a couple of weeks later you should receive at least 100 orders for report # 2 . if you do n't , continue advertising or sending e-mails until you do . once you have received 100 or more orders for report # 2 , you can relax , because the system is already working for you , and the cash will continue to roll in ! this is important to remember : every time your name is moved down on the list , you are placed in front of a different report . you can keep track of your progress by watching which report people are ordering from you . if you want to generate more income , send another batch of e - mails or continue placing ads and start the whole process again ! there is no limit to the income you will generate from this business ! before you make your decision as to whether or not you participate in this program . please answer one question . do you want to change your life ? if the answer is yes , please look at the following facts about this program : 1 . you are selling a product which does not cost anything to produce , ship or advertise . 2 . all of your customers pay you in cash ! 3 . e - mail is without question the most powerful method of distributing information on earth . this program combines the distribution power of e-mail together with the revenue generating power of multi-level marketing . 4 . your only expenses other than your initial $ 20 investment is your time ! 5 . virtually all of the income you generate from this program is pure profit ! 6 . this program will change your life forever . * * * * * * * t e s t i m o n i a l s * * * * * * * this program does work , but you must follow it exactly ! especially the rule of not trying to place your name in a different position , it won't work and you ' ll lose a lot of potential income . i ' m living proof that it works . it really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money , with little cost to you . if you do choose to participate , follow the program exactly , and you ' ll be on your way to financial security . sean mclaughlin , jackson , ms the main reason for this letter is to convince you that this system is honest , lawful , extremely profitable , and is a way to get a large amount of money in a short time . i was approached several times before i checked this out . i joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money required . to my astonishment , i received $ 36 , 470 . 00 in the first 19 weeks , with money still coming in . sincerely yours , phillip a . brown , esq . not being the gambling type , it took me several weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan . but conservative that i am , i decided that the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that i would n't get enough orders to at least get my money back . boy , was i surprised when i found my medium-size post office box crammed with orders ! for a while , it got so overloaded that i had to start picking up my mail at the window . i ' ll make more money this year than any 10 years of my life before . the nice thing about this deal is that it does n't matter where in the u . s . the people live . there simply is n't a better investment with a faster return . mary rockland , lansing , mi . i had received this program before . i deleted it , but later i wondered if i should n't have given it a try . of course , i had no idea who to contact to get another copy , so i had to wait until i was e-mailed another program . . . 11 months passed then it came . . . i did n't delete this one ! . . . i made more than $ 41 , 000 on the first try ! ! d . wilburn , muncie , in this is my third time to participate in this plan . we have quit our jobs , and will soon buy a home on the beach and live off the interest on our money . the only way on earth that this plan will work for you is if you do it . for your sake , and for your family 's sake do n't pass up this golden opportunity . good luck and happy spending ! charles fairchild , spokane , wa i am nearing the $ 90 , 000 mark from this program . i have used several forms of advertisement . i used regular mail and bulk email . the regular mail was very expensive for 2 reasons . i purchased a very select list names , and the postage . the 3rd time i sent out e - mails , in the quantity of 700 , 000 . so , after 3 times participating in this program , i am almost at the $ 90 , 000 mark . that is n't too bad . i hope the same success for you . good luck . . . . raymond mccormick , new cannan , ct . you have great potential for extra earnings that is available at your finger-tips ! you have unlimited access to wealth , but you must be willing to take that first step ! the media already proved that ! ! ! ! ! ! you could be making an obscene amount of money ! i have given you the information , materials , and opportunity to become financially better off . it is up to you now ! - think about it - your risk is only $ 20 . ?

"re : 3 . 402 queries : language - speakers , syntax , texts i would like to address the issue of "" who speaks languages ? "" it seems to me that this is a big problem . while linguists study structures of various kinds , language teachers study literature , and , if they ' re lucky , pedagogy ( very few graduate schools offer any theoretical orientation to teaching to literature students , which is where most college language teachers come from ) . thus many college language teachers must teach without background ( and with resentment , for some ) while they research in a different area entirely . when some linguists teach languages , they teach structures , not speaking . thus , when taking an unusually-taught language under the auspices of a linguistics department , all we did was talk about structure , we never learned to speak it . talking about language was thrown out many years ago as a way to learn to speak ! neither group , unhappy literature teachers nor structure-happy linguists , are likely to improve the image of language learning in this country . leslie morgan morgan @ loyvax",Safe Email

SUMMARYAs part of an ongoing NASA/UAH joint project, Dr. John Christy of UAH and Dr. Roy Spencer of NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center use data gathered by microwave sounding units (MSUs) on National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration TIROS-N satellites to get accurate, direct measurements of atmospheric temperatures for almost all regions of the Earth, including remote deserts, rain forests and oceans for which reliable temperature data are not otherwise available.The accuracy and reliability of temperature data gathered by the satellites since January 1979 has been confirmed by comparing the satellite data to independent temperature data. A recent study (1) found a 97 percent agreement between the MSU data and temperatures measured by thermometers suspended beneath weather balloons released by meteorologists for weather observations.Once the monthly temperature data is collected from the satellites and processed, it is placed in a ""public"" computer file for immediate access by atmospheric scientists in the U.S. and abroad. It has become the basis for a number of major studies in global climate change, and is cited in reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.GATHERING THE DATAWhile traditional thermometers measure the temperature at a specific point in the air, a microwave sounding unit on a satellite takes readings that are average temperatures in a huge volume of the atmosphere. Each of the more than 30,000 readings per day per satellite is an average temperature for more than 75,000 cubic kilometers of air.The MSU makes a direct measurement of the temperature by looking at microwaves emitted by oxygen molecules in the atmosphere. The intensity of the microwave emissions - their ""brightness"" - varies according to temperature.Christy and Spencer developed a method to take the data from several satellites and produce a unified temperature dataset.VERIFYING THE ACCURACY OF MSU MEASUREMENTSA recent comparison (1) of temperature readings from two major climate monitoring systems - microwave sounding units on satellites and thermometers suspended below helium balloons - found a ""remarkable"" level of agreement between the two.To verify the accuracy of temperature data collected by microwave sounding units, Christy compared temperature readings recorded by ""radiosonde"" thermometers to temperatures reported by the satellites as they orbited over the balloon launch sites.He found a 97 percent correlation over the 16-year period of the study. The overall composite temperature trends at those sites agreed to within 0.03 degrees Celsius (about 0.054Â° Fahrenheit) per decade. The same results were found when considering only stations in the polar or arctic regions.""The idea was to determine the reliability of the satellite data by comparing it to an established independent measurement,"" Christy said. ""If satellite data are reliable when the satellites are over the radiosonde sites, that means you should be able to trust them everywhere else.""The 99 radiosondes reported an aggregate warming trend of 0.155 degrees Celsius (about 0.28Â° Fahrenheit) per decade since 1979. Over those 99 spots on the globe, the satellites also recorded a warming trend: 0.128 degrees Celsius (about 0.23Â° Fahrenheit) per decade.Globally, however, the satellite data show a cooling trend of 0.03 degrees Celsius per decade since the first NOAA TIROS-N satellites went into service.""These 99 radiosonde launch sites are just not distributed evenly around the planet,"" Christy said. ""They are not representative of the total globe.""Radiosonde balloons are released from stations around the world, usually at noon and midnight Greenwich standard time. As each balloon climbs from the surface to the stratosphere, the temperature is measured and relayed to the ground by radio.While there are more than 1,000 radiosonde launch sites globally, the data from many sites either are not readily available or are not consistently collected. Christy used data from 99 sites at which there has been long-term systematic and reliable data collection. These 99 radiosonde launch sites are in a box bounded by Iceland, Trinidad, Truk Island and Alaska.In an earlier study, an upper air temperature record compiled by NOAA from 63 daily weather balloon sites around the world indicated a 17-year climate trend of -0.05Â° C per decade, which was in exact agreement with the satellite data at that time, Christy said.GLOBAL COVERAGEOne advantage of the MSU dataset is its global coverage. Microwave sounding units aboard NOAA satellites directly measure the temperature of the atmosphere over more than 95 percent of the globe. Each satellite measures the temperature above most points on Earth every 12 hours.The 'global temperature' that has been frequently reported from surface measurements is neither global in extent nor systematic in measurement method. It neglects vast oceanic and continental regions, including Antarctica, the Brazilian rain forests, the Sahara Desert and Greenland.The most commonly cited historical temperature dataset is from ground-based thermometers. More than 5,000 thermometers worldwide provide almost instantaneous local temperature data through links to weather services and scientists.Most of these thermometers, which are usually in small shelters about five feet above the ground, are in areas easily accessible to people. In the U.S. and other industrial countries, these thermometers are most often found at airports.The ground-based network is extensive in North America, Europe, Russia, China and Japan. It is less comprehensive in Africa, South America, Australia and across much of Southern Asia.Temperatures on the surface and vertically through the atmosphere are gathered daily by thermometers carried aloft by helium balloons. ""Radiosonde"" balloons are released from stations around the world, usually at noon and midnight Greenwich standard time.While balloon release sites are scattered throughout the world, they are concentrated in industrial nations. There are more than 1,000 radiosonde launch sites globally. If they were evenly distributed around the world, that would equal approximately one for every 195,000 square miles of the Earth's surface.Water temperatures, which are used to derive estimates of atmospheric temperatures, come from thermometers on piers and buoys, and aboard ""ships of opportunity."" The ships record the temperature of water drawn in to cool their engines. The water temperature data from these instruments is also not global in its coverage, tending instead to be concentrated in heavily-travelled shipping lanes, and in harbors.In the past 12 years, a new system of approximately 100 deep ocean buoys has been established, gathering both atmospheric and water temperature data.INSTRUMENT ACCURACY; MSUWith nine satellites measuring the temperature over periods of from one to six years, a method was devised to merge all the data into a single, consistent time series.Each satellite has its own bias that, if not calculated and removed, would introduce spurious trends. The biases are calculated by directly comparing each satellite with others in operation at that time. Periods of overlapping operation ranged from three months to three years, and were sufficient to determine these biases.Because the MSU instruments are so stable and have so many thousands of observations, the biases between the satellites are known to within 0.01 deg. The final product removes these biases so that all data are referenced to a common base. (2)To check the final product, comparisons were made over a 16-year period with balloon measurements as stated above, and the phenomenal agreement provided the independent validation necessary to conclude that the merging technique developed for this dataset was accurate.INSTRUMENT ACCURACY; GROUND-BASED THERMOMETERSOf great concern to scientists is the lack of consistency in the way readings are taken and in the thermometer surroundings. Since most thermometers for which long-term records exist are in towns and cities, the effects of population growth and the construction of nearby roads, parking lots, runways and buildings may cause the temperature to rise a little due of urbanization. This temperature change may be an artifact of a local ""asphalt effect"" rather than a long-term widespread climate change.INSTRUMENT ACCURACY; SHIPS OF OPPORTUNITYWhile the temperature data collected by ships at sea is reported as a sea surface temperature, this data reflects water temperatures from about three to 60 feet below the surface - the level from which water is drawn into the ships.The thousands of individual thermometers used to collect this data are not calibrated against a scientific standard, nor is there a method for verifying the accuracy of either the thermometers or the reports matching temperature readings to specific times and places.Only in places where there are many overlapping observations can there be any confidence in their accuracy.THE SCIENTISTSIn 1996, Spencer and Christy received the American Meteorological Society's Special Award. They were honored ""for developing a global, precise record of the Earth's temperature from operational polar-orbiting satellites, fundamentally advancing our ability to monitor climate.""AMS Special Awards are given to individuals or organizations not appropriately recognized by more specifically-defined awards, and who have made important contributions to the science or practice of meteorology or to the society.In 1991, Spencer and Christy received NASA's Exceptional Scientific Achievement Medal.DR.

No offense or anything, but there's a difference between holding a
sign that doesn't agree with Bush and screaming at him.My sole point, as far as the 1st Amendment goes is that there is more
to this game than just being an angry, liberal youth.  (Which is the
gross culmination of everyone's argument sofar)  The screaming isn't
the most effective method around.  I don't believe I argued that it
was.  But screaming is happening because the means to communicate to
the representatives involved are diminishing, at least as far as the
people doing the screaming are concerned.   For the record, I don't
support the screamers in organized conferences (Such as the Colin
Powell shout-down that was mentioned earlier).  I don't think that
this is what the 1st Amendment was implying.  These folks -do- have a
right to be heard, and I think they have a right to be heard by the
folks they elected in the first place.My point, (my only point) was really more concerned with the cases
such as Mr. Nell.   He wasn't engaged (at least from the limited facts
we have) in a shoutout, but rather in a difference of opinion.   He
has a right to possess this opinion and make it known  to the
representatives that are elected.   A sign is not a shout-out.I think I may have missed (or not accurately addressed) the original
thread switch that took this example and mixed in the screaming
dissenters to the mix.  I was mostly responding with my miffedness in
having broad-brush strokes applied to a group without examining the
policy reasons that might have contributed to it.   IN this case, the
screaming parties are fed up with getting corralled miles away from
the folks they need to speak with.   They're resorting to creative,
offensive and constitutionally challengable means, but its not simply
due to the fact that they're 20 and have lost all decorum.   The 'My
generation never did this ' is all BS.   THere's more to this story,
we just dont' know it all.I hope this clarifies my position.   For the quick rehash:Screaming != Free speech on all cases.
Dissent = Free speech, provided you follow what has been laid down by
the Supremes.K?--

"http://www.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/americas/08/26/peru.mother.reut/index.htmlLIMA, Peru (Reuters) -- Lina Medina's parents thought their 5-year-old daughter had a huge abdominal tumor and when shamans in their remote village in Peru's Andes could find no cure, her father carried her to hospital. Just over a month later, she gave birth to a boy. Aged 5 years, seven months and 21 days old when her child was born by Caesarean section in May 1939, Medina made medical history, and is still the youngest known mother in the world. At the time, Peru's government promised aid that never materialized. Six decades on, Medina lives with her husband in a cramped house in a poor, crime-ridden district of the Peruvian capital known as ""Little Chicago."" Now 68, she keeps herself to herself and has long refused requests to rake up the past. Gerardo, the son she delivered while still a child herself, died in 1979 at the age of 40. But a new book, written by an obstetrician who has been interested in her case, has drawn fresh attention to Medina's story, and raised the prospect that the Peruvian government may belatedly offer her financial and other assistance. ""The government condemned them to live in poverty. In any other country, they would be the objects of special care,"" Jose Sandoval, author of ""Mother Aged 5,"" told Reuters. ""We still have time to repair the damage done to her. That's my fundamental objective,"" he added. 'Totally willing to help'
Sandoval has raised Medina's case with the office of first lady Eliane Karp, and has asked the government to grant her a life pension -- something officials say is possible. ""We're totally willing to help her,"" said spokeswoman Marta Castaneda. But Suni Ramos, of the social action department of Karp's office, said that before the government could grant her a pension or any other of the aid it was already planning -- such as kitchen and other household equipment -- it needed to talk to her to discuss what she wanted and needed. It is currently trying to contact Medina and her family. Medina's husband, Raul Jurado, told Reuters his wife remained skeptical. ""She got no help (in 1939) that I know about,"" he said. ""She thinks governments never deliver. Maybe today there will be a promise that will never come true."" Jurado said his wife, whose story is a medical textbook classic and whose case is confirmed as true by such bodies as the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, had turned down Reuters' request for an interview. Medical rarity
No one has ever established who was the father of Medina's child, or confirmed she became pregnant after being raped. One of nine children born to country folk in Ticrapo, an Andean village at an altitude of 7,400 feet (2,250 meters) in Peru's poorest province, Medina is believed to be the youngest case of precocious puberty in history, Sandoval said. He said she had her first period at 2 1/2, became pregnant aged 4 years and eight months and that when doctors performed the Caesarean to deliver her baby, they found she already had fully mature sexual organs. Her swelling stomach worried her parents. ""They thought it was a tumor,"" he said. But shamans ruled out village superstitions -- including one in which locals believed a snake grew inside a person until it killed them -- and recommended they take her to hospital in the nearest big town, Pisco. There came the staggering diagnosis that she was pregnant. Her father was jailed temporarily on suspicion of incest -- he was later released for lack of evidence -- and doctors, police and even a film crew set off for her village for preliminary investigations into her case. Sandoval, who based his book on media and other published information, and some interviews with relatives as Medina herself declined to comment, said news of the child mother-to-be drew instant offers of aid, including one worth $5,000 from a U.S. businessman, which was turned down. More offers followed after Medina was transferred to a Lima hospital, where her fully developed 6-pound (2.7 kg) baby was born on May 14, 1939 -- Mother's Day. One offer was worth $1,000 a week, plus expenses, for Medina and her baby to be exhibited at the World's Fair in New York. Another, from a U.S. business that the family accepted in early June 1939, was for the pair to travel to the United States for scientists to study the case. The offer included setting up a fund to ensure their lifelong financial comfort. But within days, the state trumped all previous offers, decreeing that Medina and her baby were in ""moral danger,"" and resolving to set up a special commission to protect them. But Sandoval said: ""It abandoned the case after six months ...It did absolutely nothing for them."" Happy ending?
Though physically mature, Medina -- who Sandoval said was mentally normal and showed no other unusual medical symptoms -- still behaved like a child, preferring to play with her dolls instead of the new baby, who was fed by a wet nurse. Medina stayed in hospital for 11 months, finally returning to her family after it began legal proceedings that led to a Supreme Court ruling allowing her to live with them again. After taunting from schoolmates, Gerardo -- who was named after one of the doctors who attended Medina and became their mentor -- discovered when he was 10 that the woman he had grown up believing to be his sister was in fact his mother. He died in 1979 from a disease that attacks the body's bone marrow, but Sandoval said it was not clear there was any link with his illness and the fact his mother had been so young. Medina married and in 1972 had a second son, 33 years after her first. Her second child now lives in Mexico. She appears to have turned her bizarre story into a taboo subject. ""We just want to get on with our lives, that's it,"" said Jurado, adding he thought ""absolutely nothing"" of the fact his wife was the world's youngest mother. He said the couple's main concern now, if the government's offer of aid was genuine, was to be granted the value of a property that belonged to Medina and which the then-government expropriated more than two decades ago. That house has now been destroyed and there is a road on the site. He said its value was ""more or less $25,000"" and settling the property question would conclude a long legal battle to get back a home of their own -- they live now in a modest house, accessed down a dingy alley half blocked by a wooden board, in a tough neighborhood known to locals as a thieves' paradise. ""If the government really wants to help...they should give us the value of our property,"" he said. As for Sandoval, he said he was optimistic that Medina's story, which he has studied since his student days, would turn out well. ""I believe there will be a happy ending,"" he said. ""As a result of the war, corporations have now been enthroned and an era
of corruption in high places will follow and the money-power of the
country will endeavor to prolong its reign by working upon the
prejudices of the people until the wealth is aggregated in a few hands
and the Republic is destroyed.""

"Ananova:Â  
Dracula theme park could be switched to BucharestA controversial scheme to build a Dracula theme park in Romania could be
switched away from Transylvania.
Consultants PricewaterhouseCoopers is now recommending that it be built in
Bucharest instead.
It comes after Prince Charles led international protests against the
original proposals to build it in the medieval town of Sigishoara.
PricewaterhouseCoopers name Bucharest, originally believed to be an outsider
in the race to host the park, as the most profitable location for the
project.
But that has angered residents in Sigishoara, where Vlad the Impaler, the
inspiration for Dracula, was born. They are counting on the park to boost
the local economy.
Evenimentul Zilei reports that Sigishoara was placed behind the capital with
the Black Sea port of Constanta third choice.
Dorin Danesan, mayor of Sigishoara, said: ""The pre-feasibility report from
PWC shows that the park would attract more tourists if it was located in
Bucharest. But I still think that Sigishoara is the best location for it.""
The park would include hotels, a Dracula roller coaster, catacombs, a ghost
train and a house of horrors, as well as vampire dungeons located around a
reconstruction of Dracula's castle and an artificial lake.
The project has also been objected to by the world heritage organisation
Unesco fearing Sigishoara might be spoilt.
PricewaterhouseCoopers is to present its final report on the project on
October 15.

Date: 2002-09-24T05:32:00-0700There are a few net innovations that have far greater ramifications than you 
would, at first hearing, expect them to. Napster, at heart just IRC with a UI, 
was one. Google News[1] is another. In its first day, I've already noticed: - The front page changes its editorial stance depending on where the earth's 
terminator[2] is. So in the evening on the West Coast, Google News is lead by 
the South China Morning Post, and various Asian english-language papers. By the 
late evening, the BBC and European papers are kicking in. 
- The site may be created by algorithms - but what about the choice of sites? 
The most arbitrary dividing line I see in Google's coverage is what is a news 
site, and what isn't. Slashdot[3] is, for instance, as well as some very 
obscure[4] newspapers. What about Blues News[5] or Scripting News[6], though? 
- Big companies spend mucho money paying ""clipping services"" that send them 
copies of any press coverage they receive. Clipping services are going to have 
to find some added value, very[7] very[8] quickly. [1] http://news.google.com/

' ' traders and analysts have speculated that enron metals would be sold since dynegy inc . agreed earlier this month to buy enron corp . for $ 23 billion . after that accord collapsed yesterday , the metals unit seemed slated for a sale , analysts said . enron agreed to buy the business , formerly mg plc , for $ 445 million in may of last year . mg itself was the metals - trading unit of germany ' s metallgesellschaft ag and a century - old operation upon which that german construction , engineering and trading company was built . it is one of just 11 floor traders on the london metal exchange , the world ' s biggest metals bourse . enron earned commissions though brokering trades there , charged rent at its warehouses owned by henry bath & son ltd . and speculated on the direction of metals prices . declining market the former chief executive of metallgesellschaft , heinz schimmelbusch , in an interview earlier this month denied speculation that his pennsylvania - based safeguard international fund lp was interested in buying enron or any metals - trading operation . hsbc , europe ' s biggest bank by market value , said last month it ' s considering a plan to add trading of industrial metals such as copper and aluminum to its precious - metals trading operation to meet demand from its customers . any interest from glencore may stem from its desire to expand its existing operations , said mike price , head of mining and metals at societe generale , which is itself a so - called ring dealer , or floor trader , on the lme . whoever buys enron metals ` ` has to be somebody pretty substantial , ' ' price said . if the current management hopes to be the buyer , ` ` they would need to find somebody with deep pockets . ' ' the new owner of enron metals will be entering the metals market at a time when copper prices have declined 15 percent this year and aluminum prices are 7 percent down as demand dropped from users such as aircraft makers and electronics companies amid slowing economies . the declining prices have led n . m . rothschild & sons , a member of the lme , to quit base metals trading and prompted scotiamoccata , a metals - trading unit of canada ' s bank of nova scotia to leave the lme ring . the departure of scotiamoccata reduced the number of ring dealers to 11 and raised doubts about the future of open - outcry trading at the exchange . the lme is promoting less - expensive electronic trading . german bank enron exposure between $ 9 million and $ 100 million 2001 - 11 - 29 13 : 32 ( new york ) german bank enron exposure between $ 9 million and $ 100 million frankfurt , nov . 29 ( bloomberg ) - - dresdner bank ag , which is owned by allianz ag , said its exposure to enron corp . is about $ 100 million . deutsche bank ag and commerzbank ag said their exposure to enron amounts to a ` ` double - digit ' ' million euros amount . europe ' s largest bank has an exposure ` ` significantly ' ' below 100 million euros ( $ 89 million ) , said ronald weichert , a spokesman for deutsche bank . commerzbank ' s exposure is more than 10 million euros and less than 50 million euros , spokesman peter pietsch said . dresdner expects ` ` way less ' ' than $ 100 million to default , and will take the appropriate loan loss reserves at the end of the year , said spokeswoman elke pawellek . the largest u . s . energy trader , may file for bankruptcy protection after dynegy inc . yesterday abandoned its proposed merger with enron , forcing enron to liquidate assets to pay some of its $ 15 billion in publicly held debt . enron corp . is poised to file largest - ever bankruptcy case 2001 - 11 - 29 14 : 04 ( new york ) enron corp . is poised to file largest - ever bankruptcy case washington , nov . 29 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . is poised to file the largest bankruptcy reorganization in history after dynegy inc . scuttled plans to acquire the energy trader that is saddled with more than $ 15 billion in debt . enron , with less than $ 2 billion in cash as of last week , must pay $ 690 million to lenders by mid - december and is responsible for another $ 3 . 9 billion in debt owed by affiliated partnerships . the houston - based company ' s collapse was underscored by new restrictions on its operations . the new york mercantile exchange barred floor members from accepting orders from enron without special written authorization , and the company ' s internet trading was reduced from about 30 commodities to three products . a bankruptcy filing by enron would top texaco inc . ' s record $ 35 . 9 billion case in 1987 , with creditors lining up to claim what ' s left of the company ' s more than $ 61 billion in assets . ` ` it ' s a black hole , ' ' said gary hindes , managing director of deltec asset management llc , which has no investment in enron . ` ` until the forensic accountants can get in there and sort things out , you just don ' t know what enron ' s worth . ' ' duke energy corp . , j . p . morgan chase & co . , williams cos . and a dozen other companies say they may lose more than $ 1 billion combined from enron ' s collapse . electricity and natural gas companies said enron owed them almost $ 600 million as of yesterday . in london , was appointed administrator of enron ' s european holding company and some of its operating companies , a step other companies have taken before filing chapter 11 papers in the u . s . enron shares have lost more than $ 26 billion in market value in the last six months . lawyers enron has hired the law firm weil gotshal & manges llp , which has the nation ' s largest bankruptcy practice , and the blackstone group lp investment banking firm . arthur newman , head of restructuring at blackstone , said his firm was retained but declined to comment further . chapter 11 would let enron officials continue to control the company while negotiating a recovery plan with creditors . a provision of u . s . bankruptcy law automatically blocks debt - collection efforts , lawsuits and other actions against the company . ` ` a chapter 11 filing can be a great thing for a cash - starved company being attacked from all sides , ' ' said nancy rapoport , dean of the university of houston law center . thousands affected an enron bankruptcy would affect thousands of people , including the company ' s 21 , 000 employees , its customers , suppliers , investors and other creditors . the court - supervised recovery process would give enron a chance to change strategies and fix mistakes . it might take years to complete and may end in the company ' s liquidation . in addition to its energy trading operation , enron operates a nationwide gas pipeline system spanning 25 , 000 miles . it also owns portland general electric , which generates and distributes power to about 725 , 000 customers in the pacific northwest . the company ' s enron broadband services is building a global fiber - optic communications network . chapter 11 reorganization lets companies abandon onerous contracts and unprofitable leases . ` ` every bad business deal enron got into they ' ll walk away from , ' ' said peter chapman , a distressed - debt investor who also publishes newsletters on high - profile bankruptcy reorganizations . recovery the goal in chapter 11 is a recovery plan that allows a company to pay creditors and come out of bankruptcy . a plan typically must be approved by a majority of creditors representing two - thirds of a company ' s debts . then a company would ask a bankruptcy judge for final approval . the recovery plan divides a company ' s value among various classes of creditors . under a hierarchy set by the u . s . bankruptcy code , secured creditors - - those with collateral backing their claims - - are paid ahead of unsecured creditors , such as bondholders and suppliers . financial advisers to creditors and companies in large bankruptcies say a chapter 11 recovery plan for enron would be particularly difficult to produce . ` ` you have a host of intangible assets combined with a morass of contingent liabilities creating a potential witches ' brew of a bankruptcy , ' ' said jeff werbalowsky of houlihan lokey howard & zukin , an investment banking firm that has been contacted for advice by enron bondholders . shareholders enron ' s shareholders are likely to lose all of their investment in a chapter 11 case because they would be last in line to get paid . enron shares fell 20 cents , or 33 percent , to 41 cents in afternoon trading . the shares traded at $ 54 . 54 on june 4 . the company said this morning it was evaluating whether it will pay a scheduled 12 . 5 - cent quarterly dividend on dec . 20 . enron ' s bond prices reflect the uncertainty about the company ' s value . the company ' s 6 . 4 percent notes that mature in 2006 were unchanged at about 22 cents on the dollar , traders said . at that price the notes yield 53 percent . some recovery for enron creditors in a bankruptcy case may come from lawsuits , said russell a . belinsky , an investment banker with chanin capital partners , which also has been approached for advice by enron bondholders . ` ` there ' s a lot of juicy legal issues , ' ' said belinsky . potential targets include enron ' s accounting firm and its officers and directors . ` ` disentangling all the pieces in a reorganization is going to be a painstaking job , ' ' he said . liability dynegy might face some liability for canceling its purchase of enron . dynegy invoked terms of the buyout agreement that gave it the right to purchase an enron natural gas pipeline if the takeover fell apart . dynegy received the right to the pipeline in exchange for a $ 1 . 5 billion investment in enron by chevrontexaco corp . , which owns one - fourth of dynegy . enron might use bankruptcy to prevent dynegy from walking away from the buyout and claiming ownership to the pipeline . the dynegy acquisition , valued at $ 23 billion when it was proposed on nov . 9 , collapsed as bankers failed to raise the $ 1 . 5 billion enron needed to operate until the deal was completed . the lack of funds and a credit downgrade contributed to dynegy ' s decision . bankers led by j . p . morgan chase & co . vice chairman james b . lee tried for two weeks to raise the cash enron needed . investors turned them down because of heightened concern enron wouldn ' t be able to pay its debts . three credit - rating agencies yesterday cut enron ' s credit rating to junk status , triggering an acceleration of the company ' s debt obligations . unraveling enron ' s unraveling began in october after it said shareholders ' equity was reduced by $ 1 . 2 billion because of the way the company accounted for outside partnerships it created . the announcement prompted lawsuits and an investigation by the u . s . securities and exchange commission , and enron ended up restating earnings for almost five years . as shares plunged , enron ' s trading partners lost confidence the company would have the cash to pay bills . trading partners such as mirant corp . either demanded more collateral to trade or restricted trading with the company . ` ` the situation is dire , ' ' said deltec ' s hindes . ` ` no one ' s going to trade with enron right now because you could wind up being an unsecured creditor tomorrow .

I had gotten the full package from eircom and elected to take the Zytel Prestige 645M (that M is very important) But alas I cannot get it to work even with another Major and popular graphical OS. So after almost 8 hours onto adsl support trying to conince them that they did actually supplu and support the 645M and not just the 643 and 645R its still not working. So, after all that I am going to try a poweredge to connect and if all else fails I will wait till Eircom send me out a replacement ( I am going to have to look for the Alcatel this time :-) But while I was doing my googleing I came acroos thishttp://www.roaringpenguin.com/pppoe/how-to-connect.txt http://www.roaringpenguin.com/pppoe/And they look very cool for the beginner. Also the is a cool article on www.linux.ie about USB and ADSL with PPPoE on Linux. ANyhow when I do get it working (either with the 645 MMMMM or something else) I will put up a howto but really the above is quite cool.Aj- ---------------------------------------- AJ McKee NMTB mediaPhone: (Europe) +353 1 473 53 72 (North America) +1 206 339 4326Fax: (Europe) +353 1 473 53 73 (North America) +1 206 339 4326Website: http://www.nmtbmedia.com - ----------------------------------------- >-----Original Message----- >From: ilug-admin@linux.ie [mailto:ilug-admin@linux.ie]On Behalf Of >Brian O'Donoghue >Sent: 16 August 2002 17:42 >To: 'ilug@linux.ie' >Subject: RE: [ILUG] ADSL, routers and firewalls > > >> To get the 3 computers talking to each other, you need a hub >which you can >> pick up for a small amount of money.

"Hi all.
Does anyone know how to set up dual keyboards(one is actually a stand-alone
keypad)?
Both keyboards have PS/2 connections and I want the keypad to be plugged in
as the primary input device.  Then if the other keyboard is plugged in, that
should take over.
Possible?  Any possible hacks?

"I knew it'd be a day for insanity.so anyway, news.com decided to write up two wonderful articles on the
DMCA and decided to link to decss.exe, the very verboten code that
ended up getting 2600 (but none of the other news services that
originally linked) spanked.Slashdot, of course, links to them.So now, I link to slashdot.http://slashdot.org/articles/02/10/07/1331217.shtml?tid=123I find this all incredibly funny really.  Congress _and_ the courts
relaly do need to be considering how laws such as the DMCA are
applied.  For the most part, these rules are coming down to whose
friend you happen to be, how nefarious the defendant party is, and how
asleep the judge is behind the case (asleep/self-interested/bought).
Its giving me a real cynical view on being a lawyer, thats for sure.--

you absolutely detest qt and some programs are rebuildable from sources
with different %configure options. You can get src.rpm, edit spec, bump
release numberwith your initials and another number and rebuild, insert
into apt and let loose... :)Doesn't freshrpms have updates dir too? Maybe not quite as up to date as
up2date but still. I would never use up2date. There is another
repository at apt-rpm.tuxfamily.org IIRC. Not sure if that had The
updates._______________________________________________

of the small deeply ethnic neighbourhoods, if you stray more than 50
feet from Wellesley and Jarvis or Queen and Spadina, you're in
doughnutland; there's far more like the eateries in the Eaton Centre
than there are quaint cafes like McCaul north of Dundas, and the rare
little eateries are not brimming with lunchtime traffic (you can still
find a seat at noon at Village by the Grange)When most of Toronto does not live in those neighbourhoods but instead
lives in Scarborough, Malton, Mississauga and Markham (franchisevilles), you
will quickly see that one or two trendy strips does not save an entire
nation.

It has a couple different definitions.  The most common is Luser 
[sic] Attitude Readjustment Tool.  It was first used to describe the 
reporting of spam to ISPs that didn't think spam was bad.  Their 
attitude needed a little readjusting.  It has since taken on the 
generic meaning of reporting email/security incidents to the 
appropriate parties.  Somewhere the definition is online.  I can't 
seem to find the page though.
LART is about as good a word as any to describe reporting 
Rumplestiltskin attacks.  Come to think of it, I generally get a much 
better response to spam LARTs than I do to LARTs for other things. 
I'm always careful to say in the LART that the massive amounts probes 
on our system disrupted service to our customers and that we 
therefore consider it a DoS attack.  That tends to ellict a better 
response.  I also either include a log snippet in the email or I dump 
it to a file and make it accessible on a web server with other logs 
of hosts that abused our mail server.  That helps too. :)Justin

"" i think we ' ve proved that people will trade lme derivatives contracts online , because there are some great advantages to doing so , "" gross told reuters in a telephone interview . "" and unlike the physical markets , where things haven ' t really taken off online , all three platforms are pretty much indispensable to the market . "" both spectron and lme select are neutral platforms in which category 1 and category 2 lme members trade with each other , while enrononline is open to a wider membership but has enron itself as the sole counterparty in each transaction . this leaves a gap in the market for a multi - party trading system open to industry participants beyond the immediate trading community , gross suggested . "" i think the clear trend for metals derivatives trading for the future is for open platforms which would allow dealers and clients in the market to interact with each other online , "" he said . direct access for clients to an electronic trading environment could mean changes in the role of the broker , he said . "" clients will have the advantage of more control , more visibility and more transparency in what they do . however , they ' ll have to pay for services , "" gross said . "" you could see a situation where dealers specialise in different areas - certain dealers would provide credit functions , certain institutions would provide clearing , others would provide execution and certain companies would provide market - making . "" difficult conditions difficult market conditions are already forcing metals traders to rethink their activities ; this week alone has seen n . m . rothschild & sons exit base metals trading and both bank of nova scotia and enron looking to scale back . "" on the lme now you ' ve got low volumes , falling volatilities , falling prices and we ' re in the grips of a bear market . it ' s very , very poor for business in general , "" gross said . "" there are too many dealers around chasing a shrinking amount of business . . . each company is going to have to look very carefully at their business and their staffing levels . "" spectron has not been immune from declining volumes . "" our volumes for the first 12 months of operation were fantastic , way beyond what we had expected . however , our volumes have fallen in the recent quarter , "" gross said . "" that ' s due to two factors : first , the overall market activity is lower , and second lme select has managed to attract some of the business that we would previously have had 100 percent of . "" the company is now looking at ways to further develop its trading platform . "" we ' re beginning to investigate ways to add certain features and do things differently . that might involve creating an alternative platform where clients could access prices and thereby widen the service , "" gross said . but , he stressed , "" we have to keep the interests of our dealer clients foremost . "" uncertainty in the current environment , the lme ' s refusal to throw its weight behind either open - outcry floor trade or its new screen system - the exchange has taken pains not to express any preference and to "" allow the market to decide "" - may prove to be counterproductive , gross said . "" by having two systems running side by side . . . the exchange is almost moving in two totally different directions , "" he said . "" there ' s a feeling that the ring is doomed , which doesn ' t do anything to encourage its use , while the reluctance to fully back electronic trading means that you ' re still only seeing a trickle of business going through select in terms of overall volumes . "" while preferences vary in different sectors of the market , the current uncertainty is helping no - one , he said : "" metals traders just want to trade . they just want to know with some kind of certainty how the market will be structured in future so they can structure their business to support that and make money .

the tree lovers lawsuits that prevented removal of trees by any means as at 
least partially responsible.  The lawsuits prevented the Forest Service 
from implementation of any project that involved tree removal.  These 
projects were designed to address the tree and undergrowth density that 
resulted from previous management policies.In other words, Forest Service projects to clean up the mess resulting from 
their previous forest management practices are prevented by tree lover 
lawsuits. > 40 years after the end of the containment policy there is still a lot of

"how 's it going ? hello friend , my name is carl simmons . in october 1988 , i received this bulletin in the mail . naturally i was skeptical , but i decided to try it because i was heavily in debt at the time . i had everything to gain and nothing to lose . even if this program worked only a fraction of what the example showed , i would be a success ! well , i m adding this note here to tell you it does work ! i will never forget how it happened . i followed the instructions exactly . the total cost was about $ 46 . 00 including postage . i dropped the envelopes off a the post office on my way to work one day in late october hoping to earn a few dollars to buy christmas presents . the recipe i ordered from the person in the # 1 position came in about a week . i did not think much about it after that until a few weeks later when my boss told me my wife had called and i was needed at home immediately due to some emergency . i raced home in a panic , threw the apartment door open , and what a sight i saw ! my wife was standing over a pile of envelopes that the mailman had dumped on the living room floor from two big canvas bags . we spend the rest of the day and most of the night opening and counting 3 , 245 envelopes , each containing $ 2 . 00 and a self-addressed stamped envelope . the next day we received 4 , 274 more . by the time the orders stopped coming in , about two weeks later , i had received $ 92 , 428 . 00 in cash ! ( i wonder what the printer though when i had him print 46 , 000 copies of the recipes in one week ! ) needless to say , i immediately quit my job , paid off al my debts in full and started another mailing . to date my revenues are approaching $ 1 , 000 , 000 . 00 in cold hard cash . believe me , you can do the same thing . this is you lucky break that you have been hoping for all your life . you can make your dreams come true . . . do not pass it up ! the most difficult part was finding a good company to provide responsive names . after trying many name sources , i ran across two companies that provided the best names for this program . their addresses and prices are below : mjg advertising 200 names $ 24 . 00 p . o . box 3009 500 names $ 35 . 00 maple glen , pa 19002 1000 names $ 50 . 00 ( 215 ) 643-1328 2000 names $ 75 . 00 ( 800 ) 880-8143 marnico lists 200 names $ 20 . 00 p . o . box 2046 500 names $ 35 . 00 abington , ma 02351 1000 names $ 60 . 00 request # 3001 2000 names $ 95 . 00 making your fortune is as easy as following these six steps : 1 . send a self addressed stamped envelope and $ 2 . 00 cash wrapped in a sheet of paper specifying which recipe you are ordering by number , to addresses # 1 through # 5 at the end of this bulletin . 2 . order at least 200 names and addresses on labels from the companies mentioned earlier . 3 . while waiting for your labels to arrive , remove the name at the # 1 spot and move each of the names up one position . place your name and address in spot # 5 . move only the names and addresses - not the recipes . this can best be done by retyping the set and pasting the new over the original . 4 . have a local printshop print at least 200 copies of this bulletin . 5 . fold the printed bulletins and place in envelopes , seal and stamp them . 6 . when the labels arrive , place one on each envelope and mail them . now here s the best part - the money you can make ! here is what happens when only 10 % of the people respond to your mailing . you send out at least 200 with your name in position # 5 . 20 people send out at least 200 with your name in position # 4 . 400 people send out at least 200 with your name in position # 3 . 8000 people send out at least 200 with your name in position # 2 . 160000 people send out at least 200 with your name in position # 1 . 168420 x $ 2 . 00 each = $ 336840 in about 60 to 90 days ! ! ! of course you are not limited to mailing only 200 bulletins , or to just one mailing . send out more than 250 or do repeat mailings and you will drastically increase your earnings . when you receive 1 , 000 requests for recipe # 3 , sit back and relax knowing that you re soon going to be a very rich person . yes , this is a perfectly legal mail order marketing plan . if you are in doubt , then refer to title 18 , section 1302 and 1341 of the u . s . postal and lottery laws . a product or service must be exchanged for the money received ; in this case , the product is the recipes . this plan also takes honest work , but the rewards are tremendous . keep a careful account of all money you received and money you spend for income tax purposes . there you have it ! the secret to making thousands for yourself . read this bulletin carefully and then reread it again . think about it , do the math and consider the wealth potential this holds for you . then send $ 2 . 00 cash and a self-addressed stamped envelope today to the addresses in positions # 1 below . go for it , order those recipes today . 1 . chocolate cream pie 2 . pineapple bavarian pudding henry w . frye , sr . harold lookwood 24684 atwood ave . 123 skokorat st . moreno valley , ca 92553 seymour , ct . 06483 3 . chocolate walnut cookies 4 . cheese garlic biscuits vincent myers , jr . dlh enterprises inc . 848 n . rainbow , # 351 p . o . box 5854 las vegas , nv 89107 san jose , ca 95150 5 . magic cookies bar acw enterprises p . o . box 3004-332 corvallis , or 97333 i tried a similar program in which the cost was $ 5 . 00 . in that one , the response was only about 3 % . the first time i sent out this recipe program a got my first responses in just one week . i sent out 250 letters instead of just 100 so my percentage of gains was higher . i am trying again with 500 letters to see if i can surpass the $ 141 , 236 . 00 of the last time . good luck to all of you . it really works ! ! ! sally freisch , st louis , il",Phishing Email

"I attended the same conference, and was impressed by a few systems that
Jim didn't mention. In terms of CMS, the following all had apparently
been used in some fairly large implementations and looked like some
pretty strong competition to commercial systems:
- Midgard, http://www.midgard-project.org/ , a PHP-based content
management framework that with other programs combines to be a full CMS
- Redhat CCM CMS, Java-based: http://www.spamassassin.taint.org/software/ccm/cms/
- OpenCMS, Java-based: http://www.opencms.orgThere was agreement that usability has not generally been an open source
strength, but both Plone and Xopus represented some real movement
towards improving that situation.I was impressed by the spectrum of perspectives on XML. Some took for
granted that XSLT was relevant to content management, others took it
just as for granted that XSLT was irrelevant and seemed happy to ignore
XML almost completely. I attended realizing that ""content management"" is generally used to
apply to *Web* content management, but I was still a bit shocked how
completely out of scope document management was (almost no consideration
of the potential print/PDF dimension to content other than the
occasional ""...and you can use FOP to make PDF"" as if that was
functional): this seems more the case in open source content management
than in commercial content management, and probably makes XML easier to
ignore (if HTML is the be-all and end-all of the output...).The honesty was refreshing, Phil Suh complained about the state of
current tools (both open source and commercial), and I wish I'd written
down what he said, something like ""it sucks so extremely, it sucks so
widely, and it is so generally sucking, that it seems sometimes there is
no hope."" For a moment there was contemplation that perhaps commercial
systems scaled so well that the commercial ""big boys"" were really much
more functional than open source, until someone pointed out, ""OK, take
some average blog software, spend $500,000 on the rollout... it'll scale
pretty well."" Another quote (citing Brendan Quinn): ""content management
problems are either trivial or impossible.""Mac OS X is getting popular, of the laptops there it was an even 1/3
each of Mac, Linux, Windows.I am sure it wasn't news to Jim, but I can't wait to try Subversion, a
CVS replacement that supports some of the newer features of WebDAV:
http://subversion.tigris.org/I'm also eager to try Xopus, I hope the developers make it back home

"FROM THE DESK OF: Dr tom eke.
E-Mail:dr_tomeke@spinfinder.com
LAGOS - NIGERIA. ATTN:  
REQUEST FOR URGENT BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP. It is with my profound dignity that I write you this
very important
and highly confidential letter. First, I must
solicit your strictest
confidentiality in this transaction. This is by
virtue of its nature
as being utterly CONFIDENTIAL and ""TOP SECRET"".
Though I know that a
transaction of this magnitude will make any one
apprehensive and
worried,considering the fact that we have not met
each other before,
but I am assuring you that all will be well at the
end of the day. We
have decided to contact you by email due to the
urgency of this
transaction, as we have been reliably informed that
it will take at
least a minimum of two to three weeks for a normal
post to reach you,
so we decided it is best using the e-mail,which is
quicker and also
to enable us meet up with the second quater payment
for the year
2000. However, let me start by introducing myself properly
to you. I
am Dr.tom eke, a Director General in the Department
Of Petroleum 
Resources(D.P.R) and I presently head The Contract
Award Panel incharge
of Contract Awards and Payment Approvals. I came to
know of you in my search for a reliable and
reputable person to
handle a very confidential business transaction
which involves the
transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account
requiring
maximum CONFIDENCE. I and my colleagues are Top
Officials of the
Federal Government Contract Award Panel. Our duties
include Evaluation, Vetting, Approval for payment of
Contract jobs
done for the D.P.R e.t.c. In order to commence this
business we
solicit for your assistance to enable us transfer
into your Account
the said funds. The source of this funds is as
follows: In the second
quarter of 2001 this committee was mandated to
review and award
contracts to the tune of US$400 million US dollars
to a group of five
firms for the supply construction and installation
of Oil Pipe lines
in Warri and Port Harcourt. During this process my
colleagues and I
decided and agreed among ourselves to deliberately
over-inflate the
total contract sum from US$400 million to US$431
million United
States dollars with the main intention of sharing
the remaining sum
of US$31 miilion amongst ourselves. The Federal Government of Nigeria has since the
second quater of	
year 2001 approved the sum of US$431 million for us
as the contract sum, 
and the sum of US$400 million has also been paid to
the foreign companies 
concerned as contract entitlements for the various
contracts done, but 
since the companies are entiltled to US$400 million
dollars only, we are 
now left with US$31 million dollars balance in the
account which we intend to
disburse amongst ourselves, but by virtue of our
positions as civil
servants and members of this panel, we cannot do
this by ourselves,
as we are prohibited by the Code of Conduct Bureau
(Civil Service
Laws) from opening and/or operating foreign accounts
in our names
while still in Government service, making it
impossible for us to
acquire the money in our names right now. I have
therefore, been
delegated as a matter of trust and urgency by my
colleagues in the
panel to look for an overseas partner into whose
account we would
transfer the sum of US$31 million. Hence we are
writing you this
letter. My Colleagues and I have agreed that if you
or your company
can act as the beneficiary of this funds on our
behalf, you or your
Company will retain 20% of the total amount (US$31
million), while
70% will be for us(OFFICIALS) and the remaining 10%
will be used in
offsetting all debts/expenses and Taxes incurred
both local and
foreign in the cause of this transfer. Needless to

"from http://www.arstechnica.com/""There has mostly been talk thus far and little action, but the Department
of Justice says it may be ready to file criminal lawsuits against
individuals [1] who distribute or receive unauthorized copyrighted
material over the Internet. Deputy Assistant Attorney General John Malcolm believes
that ""criminal prosecutions of copyright offenders are now necessary to
preserve the viability of America's content industries."" Malcolm also
believes that people who trade copyrighted material think they are
participating in a legal activity. I certainly think people who download
copyrighted works understand that such distribution--barring provisions
such as fair use--is not authorized, and it is not surprising to see
businesses continue to look for means to discourage distribution of
copyrighted works.
""Some prosecutions that make that clear could be very helpful...I think
they would think twice if they thought there was a risk of criminal
prosecution,"" said [RIAA President Cary] Sherman, who was on the same
conference panel.I'm not too confident that lawsuits would have the effect Sherman is
hoping for. Although infrequent, there have already been civil suits or
warnings issued to private individuals, and they have served as minor
deterrents to the file-sharing community at large. Criminal lawsuits
carrying with them the possibility of prison sentences may generate
further animosity against groups such as the RIAA and may be difficult to
initiate because of the ""schooling"" effect of millions of systems
participating in file sharing. Only servers would seem to stand out from
the crowd.The article cites the No Electronic Theft (NET) Act [2], which defines
illegal  activity and maximum penalties for copyright infringement:
Criminal infringement: Any person who infringes a copyright willfully for
purposes of commercial advantage or private financial gain, or by the
reproduction or distribution, including by electronic means, during any
180-day period, of 1 or more copies or phonorecords of 1 or more
copyrighted works, which have a total retail value of more than $1,000....
For purposes of this subsection, evidence of reproduction or distribution
of a copyrighted work, by itself, shall not be sufficient to establish
willful infringement.
...
The term ""financial gain"" includes receipt, or expectation of receipt, of
anything of value, including the receipt of other copyrighted works.
Therefore, receipt of a work of value would be defined as ""financial gain""
even if no money is involved. The NET Act excerpt does not clarify how the
value of a work is determined; an album or movie could be worth only $15
to millions of dollars depending on whether the value is assessed from the
perspective of the consumer or copyright holder.The statute of limitations:
507. Limitations on actions(a) Criminal Proceedings.--No criminal proceeding shall be maintained
under the provisions of this title unless it is commenced within five
years after the cause of action arose.(b) Civil Actions.--No civil action shall be maintained under the
provisions of this title unless it is commenced within three years after
the claim accrued.The penalties are too extensive to list here, but they can be found in
Section 2319: Criminal infringement of a copyright. In general, first-time
criminal offenses will carry a maximum prison sentence of 1 year.I'm still not sure where the DOJ would start in choosing people to
prosecute because of the aforementioned ""schooling"" effect, but my guess
would be that, just like speeding, primarily the most prominent
individuals who operate large servers or transfer the most data will be
targeted in order to discourage more recreational file sharers. Thanks to
MonaLisaOverdrive for pointing out this story.

"DEAR SIR,I am MRS MARIAM ABACHA, wife of the late Nigerian
Head of State, General Sani Abacha who died on 
the 8th
of June 1998 while still on active duty. I am
contacting you in view of the fact that we will 
be of
great assistance to each other likewise 
developing a
cordial relationship.I currently have within my reach the sum of 
thirty
six million United States Dollars 
(US$36,000,000) in
cash, which I intend to use for investment 
purposes
specifically in your country. This money came 
as a
result of a payback contract deal between my 
late
husband and a Russian firm on our country's
Multi-Billion Dollars Ajaokuta Steel Plant. The
Russian partners returned my husbands share of
US$36,000,000 after his death and lodge it with 
my
late husband's security company in Nigeria of 
which I
am a director. Right now the new civilian 
government
have intensified their probe on my husband's 
financial
resources and they have revoked our licenses 
that
allows us to own a financial and oil company. 
In view
of this, I acted very fast to withdraw the
US$36,000,000 from the company's vault and 
deposited
it in a privately erected security safe abroad.No record ever existed concerning the money 
neither is
the money traceable by the Government because 
there is
no documentation showing that we received the 
money
from the Russians.Due to the current situation in the country 
concerning
Government attitude towards my family, it has 
become
quite impossible for me to make use of this 
money
within, thus I seek assistance to transfer this 
money
into your safe bank account. On your consent, I 
shall expect
you to contact me urgently to enable us discuss
details of this transaction.Bearing in mind that your assistance is needed 
to
transfer the funds, I propose a commission of 
20% of
the total sum to you for the expected services 
and
assistance. Your urgent response is highly 
needed so
as to stop further contacts. all correspondent 
should be forwarded to this EMAIL:zenab.m@ompadec.zzn.con
or you can call my son mobile:hamza   234-8023137978 I  use this 
opportunity to implore you to exercise the most 
utmost
indulgence to keep this matter extra ordinarily
confidential what ever your decision while I 
await your
prompt response.Best personal regards,MRS MARIAM ABACHA.--DeathToSpamDeathToSpamDeathToSpam--

import the right gpg public keys directly with rpm, for example :
rpm --import /usr/share/doc/apt-0.5.4cnc7/RPM-GPG-KEY
(this will import my key, which is used to sign all freshrpms.net packages)Hopefully it is possible to the tell rpm to install *only* packages who

1. Turns of Phrase: Beanpole family
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Historically, families have usually had more children than parents,
resulting in family trees that looked like pyramids. However, in
recent years, especially in countries like Britain and the US, the
number of children per generation has steadily gone down, while
life span has increased. This has led to a shape of family tree
that some researchers have likened to a beanpole - tall and thin,
with few people in each generation. The term ""beanpole family"" has
been around in the academic literature at least since 1987, but it
rarely appears elsewhere. A recent British report has brought it to
wider public notice, at least in the UK. Some researchers find it
too slangy and prefer the jargon term ""verticalised"" to describe
such families. Whatever term you prefer, specialists are sure that
the demographic shift is having a big effect on personal
relationships within the family and (for example) the role of
grandparents.The rising divorce rate partly explains the growth of the
'beanpole' family. With almost one in two marriages ending in
divorce, many adults have at least two families, each with a single
child.
                                             [""Observer"", May 2002]Noting the rising number of so-called 'beanpole' families in
Britain (families with only one child), the report warns that a
child without siblings 'is starved of the companionship of family
members of their own age ... [leading to] greater social isolation,
with teenagers adopting a more selfish attitude to life'.
                                            [""Guardian"", June 2002]
2. Weird Words: Jobbernowl
-------------------------------------------------------------------
A stupid person, a blockhead.Unfortunately, this useful and effective insult has rather dropped
out of use in these mealy-mouthed times. The last excursion for it
that I can find is in the classic W C Fields film ""The Bank Dick""
of 1940, in which the word occurs in a variant form in the line:
""Surely, don't be a luddie-duddie, don't be a moon-calf, don't be a
jabbernow, you're not those, are you?"". Before that, it turns up in
one of the novels of Hall Caine in 1890, but even by then it seems
to have been rather rare.It's from the old French ""jobard"", from ""jobe"", silly. That word
was then added to ""noll"", the top or crown of the head, the noddle.
The first sense was of a block-like or stupid-looking head, but was
soon extended to refer to the quality of the mind within.
""Jobbernowlism"" is the condition or state of being a ""jobbernowl"",
or an act or remark that is especially stupid.Careful how you use it: the recipient might be a subscriber!

4. Q&A
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. For my job I have to read American magazines concerning consumer
electronics, home systems, burglar alarms, etc. I very often come
across the expression ""bells and whistles"", which seem to relate to
equipment, accessories or features that are offered to the customer
as plusses but are not really indispensable for the device to work.
Is that right? And where does that funny phrase come from? [Herve
Castelain, France]Q. You're right about the meaning of this phrase, which refers to
gimmicks - non-essential but often engaging features added to a
piece of technical equipment or a computer program to make it seem
more superficially attractive without enhancing its main function.The phrase is actually quite modern and may be a product of the
American military. At least, one of its earliest appearances was in
an article in ""Atlantic"" in October 1982, which said it was
""Pentagon slang for extravagant frills"". There's some evidence that
the term has actually been around since the 1960s, but the early
evidence is sparse.Where it comes from is still a matter of learned debate. A literal
sense of the phrase appeared around the middle of the nineteenth
century, referring to streetcars, railways and steamships. Before
modern electronics, there were really only two ways to make a loud
warning noise - you either rang a bell or tooted a whistle. Steam
made the latter a real power in the land (anybody who has heard the
noisy out-of-tune calliope on the steamboat Natchez at New Orleans
will agree about its power, though less so about its glory). And at
one time ""clang, clang, clang went the trolley"" in large numbers of
American cities.At least some early US railroad locomotives had both bells and
whistles, as this extract from an article in ""Appleton's Journal""
of 1876 shows:  You look up at an angle of sixty degrees and see sweeping
  along the edge of a precipice, two-thirds up the rocky
  height, a train of red-and-yellow railway-cars, drawn by
  two wood-burning engines, the sound of whose bells and
  whistles seems like the small diversions of very little
  children, so diminished are they by the distance.Could it be that to have both bells and whistles was thought
excessive, a case of belt and braces, an unnecessary feature, a
frill?Possibly. But it's more probable the slang sense of the term comes
from that close musical relative of the calliope, the theatre
organ. Extraordinary instruments such as the Mighty Wurlitzer
augmented their basic repertoire by all sorts of sound effects to
help the organist accompany silent films, among them car horns,
sirens, and bird whistles. These effects were called toys, and
organs often had ""toy counters"" with 20 or more noisemakers on
them, including various bells and whistles. In the 1950s, decades
after the talkies came in, but while theatre organs were still
common in big movie houses, these fun features must have been
considered no longer essential to the function of the organ but
mere fripperies, inessential add-ons.It's possible the slang sense grew out of that. It got taken up
especially by the computing industry, perhaps because opportunities
to add them are so great.                        -----------Q. The designation of ""robes"" for academic dress clearly comes from
its origin with the clergy in the Middle Ages. But what about
""mortarboards""? The best I could find was its origin in the 12th or
13th century clergy cap, but that was not square-shaped. Does
""mortarboard"" refer to the guilds or is its origin more ancient?A. The academic cap often called a ""mortarboard"" is quite ancient,
but that word for it only dates from the middle of the nineteenth
century (a less slangy way to identify it is to call it a
""square""). The literal mortar board is the wooden plate, usually
with a handle underneath, on which bricklayers carry small amounts
of mortar. A similar tool is used by plasterers, but they usually
call it a hawk.What seems to have happened is that the similarity in shape between
the brickie's board and the academic cap led some wag, probably at
Oxford University, to apply the name of the one to the other. Our
first recorded use is in a book of 1853-6, ""The Adventures of Mr.
Verdant Green, an Oxford Freshman"" by a clergyman named Edward
Bradley, who wrote under the pen name of Cuthbert Bede (the names
of the two patron saints of Durham, where he went to school).
Verdant Green is a sort of undergraduate Pickwick and the book
recounts his adventures. This magisterial reprimand by a don
appears after one such escapade: ""I will overlook your offence in
assuming that portion of the academical attire, to which you gave
the offensive epithet of 'mortar-board'; more especially, as you
acted at the suggestion and bidding of those who ought to have
known better"".After a slow start, the book became a huge success, selling more
than 200,000 copies in the next 20 years. Whether Mr Bradley
invented the slang term we may never know, but his book certainly
popularised it.                        -----------Q. I got into a discussion about ""chip off the old block"" with
friends, and we are wondering if it had to do with sculpting,
jewelry making, woodworking, or none of the above. What does this
term mean, and where did it come from? [Vijay Renganathan]A. The associations are with carpentry, and the block is definitely
made of wood.The first form of the expression was ""chip of the same block"",
meaning that a person or thing was made of the same stuff as
somebody or something else, so from the same source or parentage.
An early example is in a sermon by Dr Robert Sanderson (at one time
Bishop of Lincoln), dated 1637: ""Am not I a child of the same Adam
... a chip of the same block, with him?"".Later that century, another form is recorded ""a chip of the old
block"", which meant that somebody was the spitting image of his
father, or continued some family characteristic. At some point,
probably late in the nineteenth century, this was modified to ""a
chip off the old block"", which does nothing to change the sense,
but is the way it's now usually written or said.

compression algorithm the project comes up with (fingers
crossed). And I wouldn't worry about the jpeg thing - in addition
the patent runs out next year, and I would suggest that having
failed to protect their IP for 15 years, as (iirc) is their
responsibility, their claim would probably never hold up in
court.Cheers,

he need do is click there to launch their favourite MP3 playlist.What /we/ need is a good ""barely literate"" email program.  Years ago
the university of Hawaii had a word processor that included a
voice-assist and also would pop up menus for common completions as

instructed by Late President Kabila to go abroad to purchase arms and
ammunition worth of Twenty Million, Five Hundred 
Thousand United States Dollars only (US$20,500,000.00) to fight the rebel
group. We were then given this money privately 
by the then President, LAURENT KABILA, without the knowledge of other
Cabinet Members. But when President Kabila 
was killed in a bloody shoot-out by one of his bodyguards a day before we
were schedule to travel out of Congo, We 
immediately decided to put the funds into a private security company here
in Congo for safe keeping. The security of the 
said amount is presently being threatened here following the arrest and
seizure of properties of Col. Rasheidi Karesava 
(One of the aides to Laurent Kabila) a tribesman, and some other Military
Personnel from our same tribe, by the new 
President of the Democratic Republic of Congo, the son of late President
Laurent Kabila, Joseph Kabila. In view of this, we need a reliable and trustworthy foreign partner who
can assist us to move this money out of my country 
as the beneficiary. 
WE have sufficient ''CONTACTS'' here to move the fund under Diplomatic
Cover to a security company in Europe in your 
name. This is to ensure that the Diplomatic Baggage is marked
''CONFIDENTIAL'' and it 
will not pass through normal custom/airport screening and clearance. Our inability to move this money out of Congo all this while stems from
our lack of trust of our supposed good friends 
(western countries) who suddenly became hostile to those of us who worked
with the late President Kabila, immediately 
after his son took office. Though we have neither seen nor met each other,
the information We gathered from an associate 
who has worked in your country has encouraged and convinced us that with
your sincere assistance, this transaction will 
be properly handled with modesty and honesty to a huge success within two
weeks. The said money is a state fund and 
therefore requires a total confidentiality. We would please need you to stand on our behalf as the beneficiary of this
fund in Europe. This is because we are under 
restricted movement and watch and hence we want to be very careful in
order not to lose this fund which we have worked 
so hard for. Thus, if you are willing to assist us to move this fund out
of Congo, you can contact me through my email 
addresses, Tel/Fax nos. above with your telephone, fax number and personal
information to enable us discuss the 
modalities and what will be your share (percentage) for assisting us.Please note that There are no RISKS involved in this Deal as everyone's
Security is Guaranteed if we follow the required 
guidelines. I will hence furnish you with further details of this Deal as
soon as I am assured of your Sincere interest to assist 
us. I must use this opportunity and medium to implore you to exercise the
utmost indulgence to keep this matter extraordinarily 
confidential, Whatever your decision, while I await your prompt response.
Thank you and God Bless.

Over on Arstechnica (www.arstechnica.com) I saw mention of a Wired article
that goes into the many wonderfull ways Apple is showing its love and
respect for its users.http://www.wired.com/news/mac/0,2125,55395,00.htmlThere is a good rundown of all the whys and whatfores over at
http://arstechnica.com/reviews/02q3/macosx-10.2/macosx-10.2-5.html""True to form, industrious third party developers saw that they could gain
a competitive advantage by supporting this more capable user interface in
their applications. Apple's private menu extras APIs were reverse
engineered and leveraged to great effect. The architecture was so popular
that an application for managing predefined sets of menu extras (third
party or otherwise) was in development.All of that changed with the release of Jaguar--but not because the
private APIs had changed. If they had, third party developers would have
updated their applications to work with the new APIs, as they have
resigned themselves to doing by choosing to use private APIs in the first
place.But what actually happened in Jaguar was that Apple added code to forcibly
exclude all non-Apple menu extras. Other parts of the API did not change.
But when a menu extra is loaded, it is compared to a hard-coded list of
""known"" menu extras from Apple. If the menu extra is not on that list, it
is not allowed to load.It's easy to laugh at Steve Ballmer's sweat-soaked gyrations as he chants
""developers, developers, developers!"", but Microsoft clearly understands
something that Apple is still struggling with. It is in a platform
vendor's best interest to encourage development for its platform. In
Apple's case, this doesn't mean that they have to bend over backwards to
make every single system service and UI element ""pluggable"" via public
APIs. That's clearly a lot of work, and not something that needs to be the
number one priority for an OS in its infancy. And in the meantime, if
third party developers want to sell into a market that requires the
desired functionality to be added in ""unsupported"" ways, then they must be
prepared for the maintenance consequences of their decisions.But for Apple to go out of its way--to actually expend developer
effort--to stop these third party developers, while still failing to
provide a supported alternative, is incredibly foolish. """,Safe Email
"I am trying to secure three of four virtual hostnames on our Apache server.
We are not taking credit card orders or user's personal information, but are
merely hoping to secure email and calendar web transactions for our users.
We are not running any secure applications on the root host.I have been testing this week with CA, client, and host certificate
requests, certificates, and keys, and think I have a fairly good beginner's
grasp of the commands and command line options.
My questions are:1.  Is it necessary to create a CA certificate for each of the secure
virtual hosts, or can one CA certificate for the root be used to sign each
of the keys for all three common names we are trying to secure?2.  Even though the root host is not conducting secure transactions, am I
correct in configuring the server with a CACertificateFile in the main body
of httpsd.conf and then setting the CACertificateFile for each virtual host
in the  section of httpsd.conf?  This sort of assumes the
answer to 1. is  - you need a CA for each virtual host.3.  Is it necessary to create a client certificate to distribute to our
users, or is it sufficient to have the CA certificate and a server
certificate for the virtual hosts?  Wouldn't a client certificate only be
necessary if we were trying to verify the client's identity?  Would that be
a good idea given our scenario?Thanks in advance for your help.

"urgent assistance ( confidential ) dear sir , , my name is dr steven m duba , the son of mr . theo duba of zimbabwe . i got your address from south african information exchange johannesburg . . due to the previous war against white farmers in zimbabwe by president robert mugabe and his supporters to claim all the white owned farms in our country , he ordered all the white owned farmers to surrender all their farms to his party members and his followers . my father was a victim of this oppression and inhuman behavior as he was one of the richest farmers in our country , my fayher was totaly against the act by the presidnt mugabe . the president  s supporters invaded my father  s farm , burnt everything in the farm , arrested him and confiscated all his investment . early last year when this victimization of white farmers by president mugabe started , my late father envisaged a worse situation , he arranged almost all his money concealed it in a box and smuggled it out of zimbabwe through diplomatic means to south africa . when he arrived south africa , he lodged the box in a private security company through the help of his lawyer here in south africa without revealing the real contents of the box to the security company , then , went back home . he registered the box as family treasure . while he was still in detention that led to his death due to torture , he directed me to his lawyer in south africa because of the escalation of the crisis in zimbabwe . he did not want my life to be in danger . he was arrested on the 5 th of march last year . unfortunately my dear father died on the 10 th of december 2001 . i came to south africa march , 2002 . now my stay here in africa is frustrating and depressing because my father  s lawyer is presently hospitalized in london due to terrible heart problem ; though the lodgment documents are with me , as such i want to relocate to your country for good . presently , my residence permit here in south africa is an asylum permit as a refugee . i am seeking for your assistance in transferring the money in the security company ( us $ 15 million ) out of this country to your country for investment . if you think you can help me , please try to get in touch with me immediately with the number below . your compensation / share for assistance will be negotiated if you are ready to assist me . since the problem in my country is still lingering , please endeavor to keep this information to yourself and secret , because i wouldn  t want anything that will expose me , and the existence of this money . your urgent response will be highly appreciated . sincerely yours , steven duba ( dr ) . tel : 27 - 83 - 713 - 2696 do you yahoo ! ? yahoo ! finance - get real - time stock quotes http : / / finance . yahoo . com",Phishing Email

"lrec workshop call for participation a workshop on minimizing the effort for language resource acquisition granada , spain , 26 may , 1998 in conjunction with the first international conference on language resources and evaluation granada , spain , 28-30 , may 1998 an applied nlp system must produce adequate results and must be made deployable within reasonable time . gathering and acquiring language resources to build an application system is very time-consuming , and it is imperative to find ways of speeding up acquisition of high quality , useful static knowledge sources such as a variety of grammars , lexicons , corpora , etc . viability of avoiding masive resource acquisition , if possible , must also be carefully considered . resource acquisition should include methods , based both on sound theoretical principles and practical experience , of deciding , among other things , on the amount of knowledge one * really * needs for a given application . increasing the size of knowledge sources or their number and variety does not necessarily lead to a commensurate improvement of output quality in an application , though a correlation between the two certainly exists , but it definitely needs to much increased costs . no matter how large the acquired resources are and how many of them have been acquired , there will always remain a residue of language processing problems which can be tackled only by foregoing the requirement of full automation and involving expensive semi-automatic or even manual acquisition . it becomes imperative , therefore , to assess when the static knowledge source acquisition is no longer profitable . thus , in a system for interactive authoring and automatic generation of patent claim texts , the lexical knowledge base can be restricted to a lexicon of domain-related verbs marked for subcategorization ( as the nominals are provided interactively by the author ) . the proposed workshop will be devoted to any technological and administrative facet of economy of acquisition effort . the technological issues to be discussed at the conference include , but are not limited to : - minimization of effort in acquiring monolingual and multilingual text corpora ; - minimization of effort in acquiring computational lexicons , including phonological , morphological , syntactic , semantic and other ( including application-specific ) information ; - minimization of effort in acquisition of resources for the support of corpus-based language engineering methods ; - minimization of effort in acquiring grammatical coverage of languages and sublanguages ; - methods of determining levels of reusability of existing language resources ; - balancing the needs of the application and the grain size of language description ; - minimization of effort through balancing automatic and interactive methods of knowledge acquisition ; - evaluation of potential utility of resources to applications ; we particularly encourage reports about actual practical large-scale resource acquisition efforts in which economy of effort has been a conscious choice . organizing committee : svetlana sheremetyeva , nmsu crl , usa ( chair ) eduard hovy , usc isi , usa bernardo magnini , irst , italy sergei nirenburg , nmsu crl , usa victor raskin , purdue university , usa frederique segonde , xerox research centre europe , france leo wanner , university of stuttgart , germany submission of papers papers should not exceed 4000 words or 10 pages . presentations will be selected on the basis of a review of papers and project reports . submission mode each submission should include a title page containing the title , author ( s ) , affiliation ( s ) , submitting author 's mailing address , telephone number , fax number and e-mail address . the authors may submit three hard copies or submit electronically in postscript form to : svetlana sheremetyeva computing research laboratory new mexico state university , usa box30001 / dept . 3crl / las cruces new mexico 88003-8001 lana @ crl . nmsu . edu receipt of submissions will be acknowledged . important dates thursday , february 19 , 1998 submissions due monday , march , 16 1998 acceptances and rejections friday , april 10 1998 final papers due tuesday , may 26 , 1998 workshop date registration for the workshop will be : 10 , 000 pesetas for those not attending lrec 5 , 000 pesetas for those attending lrec these fees will include a coffee break and the proceedings of the workshop . participation in the workshop will be limited by the venue . requests for participation will be processed on the first come first served basis .",Safe Email

Last week, when indexing stuff for WhoisIreland.com, I noticed that
ns0.domainregistry.ie and banba.domainregistry.ie were out of synch by a
few days. The other nameservers seemed to give a current SOA at that
time. However the affected secondaries may have been using
ns0.domainregistry.ie for axfr and propagated the error.This whole thing does seriously bring into question IEDR's decision to
outsource the technical admininstration of .ie to a company that
apparently does not even admin its own DNS.  It is a nice story though -
almost as good as the time that .ie disappeared for 8 hours in July
1998.Regards...jmcc

"california update 8 / 20 / 01 executive summary ? legislators prepare to address socal bailout options ? $ 5 . 7 b revenue notes request in state treasurer ' s hands bonds & bankruptcy : the edison mou is expected to be the major issue on the political agenda this week , and the legislative leadership wants to pass some bail - out measure by this friday ( 8 / 24 ) . while analysts are confident that there will be an mou passed , many are skeptical that the current proposals will be able to cobble together 41 votes in the assembly . the davis administration has said proceeds from the november bond sale will be used to repay the $ 6 . 2 b borrowed from general fund to purchase energy . however , repeated delays in the bond sale have caused concern . and pg & e is upset that the money will be first used to pay off the state without offsetting some of the funds the state owes pg & e . assembly republican leader dave cox has said that his members will not vote for any plan that is not a clean bailout ( i . e . without additional provisions related to environmental mitigation ) . thus , he is essentially saying his members will vote for assembly member rod wright ' s proposal , and no other current plan . but wright ' s proposal does not have much support from democrats . sources report that at least one prominent legislator , senator mike machado , has apparently remarked that he is not certain of the need to pass an mou . others may be muttering similar things , but an mou is still likely . strangely , though , no discussions were held at the staff level this week on mou legislation . the key driver in the mou debate is how much of a "" haircut "" sce will be required to take ( as a hit to the parent company ) . sources report that sce will accept a haircut of $ 500 m . however , should the haircut be placed in the range of $ 1 b , we are told that sce ' s bryson has informed his team that he would take sce into bankruptcy voluntarily . this represents a significant turnaround in sce ' s previous optimism , which is attributable to legislative indifference to the sce bankruptcy threat as well as growing tension between bryson and governor davis . as for the middle range between $ 500 m and $ 1 b , it is difficult to ascertain how high sce will go before pulling the bankruptcy trigger . short term - anticipatory notes state controller kathleen connell has asked for an emergency sale of a $ 5 . 7 b short term note ( possibly in the form of a revenue anticipation note / ran ) to cover california ' s electricity costs until november , when $ 12 . 4 b in state bonds are expected to be issue by the legislature . the state controller ' s request was made because of her legal obligation to issue a demand to the treasurer at any time she determines that the general fund has or will have insufficient funds for the payment of all appropriations by the legislature . connell claims the ran , which could be offered as early as september , is necessary because the state ' s general fund is running dry from recent power purchases . state treasurer angelides is studying the plan , but has yet to publicly comment . according to sources , he has also yet to comment to legislators , but was in new york last week meeting with people on wall street about the bond issuance . mandated by state statute , angelides can issue these notes unilaterally and does not need approval from the legislature or anyone else . he has total discretion on the issuance , its timing , and its amount . however , the state ' s general fund would not be depleted by november 15 th , even without the ran revenue . rans are not that unusual . rans were previously issued from fy 95 - 96 through fy 99 - 00 with the largest being the $ 5 b ran in fy 92 - 93 . because of california ' s recent economic growth , rans were not necessary last year and were expected to be unnecessary this year . concerns surrounding the pg & e suit filed earlier last week ( pg & e seeks priority in the $ 12 b revenue bond allocations ) are somewhat eased by a well - placed utility source who report that the suit will have little impact the revenue bond or anticipatory notes ' issuance . however , there is suspicion among some that the administration is increasingly concerned that investor confidence is weakening and that the bond issuance might be deemed a failure , and is thus promoting the idea that pg & e ' s actions are responsible , rather than investor uncertainty over revenue stream allocation and dwr contracts . in the event that the revenue bonds ' issuance is delayed past the october 31 st bridge loan maturity , the interest rate charged to the state would reportedly jump from four percent to seven percent .",Safe Email

pretty easy to find ;) I remember it from an issue perhaps in the very
late 80's or early 90's.It's interesting to note that NT7 and many other NEO bodies are all on
trajectories that approach the Earth from under the ecliptic, so with
the Earth tilt, South America becomes a pretty good target.  In trying
to find you a site through Google, I turned up several different
impact sites in Venezuela and Brazil, with ages ranging from 251M to
70 years, but not the 400km gash from the above story.  The only google refs I found from that period is one in Arizona
(famous impact crater) and another in NM; do wish I had noted the
actual South American /country/ that contains the scar; Venezuela
sticks in my mind but I can't be certain.  http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/images/meteorcrater.html--

"organizational changes we are making a number of significant organizational changes . these changes are intended to accomplish four key objectives : first , we need to realign all our wholesale businesses around the successful business model developed over the last decade in north america and europe . this model relies on extensive physical and transactional networks built around a relatively small strategic asset position . second , we need to significantly streamline corporate reporting relationships . particularly with joe sutton  , s departure , the ability to directly manage the day - to - day activities of 15 independent business units has become increasingly difficult . third , we need to accomplish these changes without , in any way , compromising the ongoing profitability of all our businesses and without delaying or hindering our effort to monetize a significant portion of our lower - yielding asset positions . and fourth , as always , we need to take advantage of the reorganization to redeploy our talent into our highest value opportunities . enron wholesale services today , we are forming enron wholesale services ( ews ) which will consolidate our global wholesale businesses . the closer alignment of our wholesale businesses will accomplish the following : ( 1 ) enhanced communication and coordination across business units , ( 2 ) more rapid deployment of people to higher valued opportunities , ( 3 ) more effective prioritization of opportunities across the wholesale business , and ( 4 ) more rapid extension of enron  , s wholesale business model and capabilities into new industries and markets . enron wholesale services will include our current north american , european ( including japan and australia ) , global markets , and industrial markets operations , and will be expanded to include enron  , s net works business unit as well as a new unit  ) enron global assets . in addition , enron  , s merchant businesses outside of north america and europe will be integrated into this new structure as described below . mark frevert , currently chairman of each of our wholesale units , will assume the role of chairman and ceo of enron wholesale services . greg whalley , currently chairman and ceo of enron net works , will join mark in the office of the chairman as president and chief operating officer . providing further impetus for these organizational changes , several of our international business unit leaders have elected to move into new leadership positions : rebecca mcdonald , currently ceo of enron apachi , will join ews as president and ceo of enron global assets . enron global assets will have responsibility for managing all of enron  , s existing energy asset portfolio outside of north america and europe . joining rebecca in the office of the chairman as coo will be jim hughes , currently coo of enron apachi . rebecca and jim will report to the ews office of the chairman . sanjay bhatnagar , currently ceo of enron india , has joined ebs as ceo for the middle east and asia region . sanjay will be responsible for building our broadband business in this region and the current ebs team in this region will report to sanjay . in this role , sanjay will report to the ebs office of the chairman . in addition , sanjay will continue to remain responsible for enron  , s wholesale energy business in india and will transition this business into enron global assets in the near future . diomedes christodoulou , currently co - ceo of enron south america , has joined ebs as chief commercial officer . diomedes will be located in london and will focus his origination activities on global opportunities , with near term attention to the wholesale and enterprise sectors . diomedes will report to the ebs office of the chairman . jim bannantine , currently co - ceo of enron south america , will be joining ees to lead ees  , commercial efforts outside north america and europe . in order to ensure a smooth transition for our south american businesses and to facilitate our asset sales activities , jim will remain in south america for at least the next several months and continue to serve as ceo of enron south america . throughout the transition , jim will report to cliff baxter and to the office of the chairman of enron wholesale services . following the transition , jim will join ees . in addition to these changes in our international asset operations activities , we are making the following changes in our merchant wholesale businesses and the commercial support functions : enron net works louise kitchen will assume greg  , s previous responsibilities as president and ceo of enron net works , reporting into mark and greg . enron americas concurrent with the transfer to enron global assets of responsibility for operating enron  , s south and central america asset base , all trading , marketing , and new asset development activities in these regions will report into a new entity , enron americas . enron americas will have responsibility for all wholesale merchant businesses across north , central and south america . dave delainey , president and ceo , and john lavorato , chief operating officer will comprise the office of the chairman for enron americas . enron europe the enron europe organization , which includes enron  , s businesses in australia and japan , and enron metals , remains unchanged under the leadership of john sherriff , president and ceo , and michael brown , chief operating officer . enron global markets enron global markets , under the leadership of mike mcconnell , president and ceo , and jeff shankman , chief operating officer , will continue to have responsibility for enron  , s middle east and lng operations . with the exception of ecoelectrica in puerto rico , all operating power plants and associated personnel in the caribbean and central america will transfer to enron global assets . enron global markets will also continue to manage the commodity businesses in crude and products , coal , weather , insurance , equities , interest rates , foreign exchange , and agricultural products . enron industrial markets enron industrial markets  , organization , under the leadership of jeff mcmahon , president & ceo , and ray bowen , chief operating officer , remains unchanged . commercial support for ews the commercial support functions for ews will remain with , and be managed by , the individual business units . we are creating no incremental overhead in the creation of ews , and in fact hope to reduce our operating costs by more efficient utilization and sharing of resources across ews . to this end we have asked several people to take on an expanded role across ews in addition to their ongoing roles within their business units . these newly defined roles are as follows : mid and back office operations  ) sally beck will lead mid and back office operations across ews . these services will become part of enron net works , with sally reporting to louise kitchen and rick causey , executive vice president and chief accounting officer . this alignment creates a coordinated services organization with it and e - commerce platforms to support the wholesale businesses and to maximize opportunities to commercialize these services . mid and back office services for all commercial activities will continue to be organized with dedicated operations controllers responsible for specific commodities and / or geographic locations . legal  ) mark haedicke will serve in the role of general counsel for ews . regulatory and government affairs  ) this function will remain organized on a regional basis . rick shapiro will support all ews businesses operating in the americas , and mark schroeder , who is based in london , will support all european and eastern hemisphere operations . rick and mark will also continue to support all other enron businesses operating in their respective regions and will continue to report to steve kean , executive vice president and chief of staff . public relations  ) this function is also organized primarily on a regional basis . eric thode will have responsibility for north american activity , enron net works , and enron industrial markets . jackie gentle will continue in her role for enron europe ( including japan and australia ) and john ambler will have responsibility for activity outside north america and europe as well as providing support for enron global markets and enron global assets . these individuals will also continue to have a split reporting relationship to mark palmer , vice president of communications . business analysis and reporting  ) wes colwell will expand his role to cover ews reporting in addition to his current role in north america . attached for your review is an organization chart for enron wholesale services which summarizes the changes described here . as this organization continues to evolve we will keep you informed of any additional changes . enron global exploration and production and enron wind as part of our company -

"" about a week later i rode [ my bike ] down to the post office and my box had 1 magazine and about 300 envelops stuffed in it . there was also a yellow slip that said i had to go up to the [ post office ] counter . i thought i was in trouble or something ( laughs ) "" . he goes on , "" i went up to the counter and they had a whole box of more mail for me . i had to ride back home and empty out my backpack because i could not carry it all "" . over the next few weeks , the boy continued sending out the e - mail . "" the money just kept coming in and i just kept sorting it and stashing it in the closet , barely had time for my homework "" . he had also been riding his bike to several of the banks in his area and exchanging the $ 5 bills for twenties , fifties and hundreds . "" i didn ' t want the banks to get suspicious so i kept riding to different banks with like five thousand at a time in my backpack . i would usually tell the lady at the bank counter that my dad had sent me in to exchange the money ] and he was outside waiting for me . one time the lady gave me a really strange look and told me that she would not be able to do it for me and my dad would have to come in and do it , but i just rode to the next bank down the street ( laughs ) . "" surprisingly , the boy did not have any reason to be afraid . the reporting news team examined and investigated the so - called "" chain - letter "" the boy was sending out and found that it was not a chain - letter at all . in fact , it was completely legal according to us postal and lottery laws , title 18 , section 1302 and 1341 , or title 18 , section 3005 in the us code , also in the code of federal regulations , volume 16 , sections 255 and 436 , which state a product or service must be exchanged for money received . every five - dollar bill that he received contained a little note that read , "" please send me report number xyx "" . this simple note made the letter legal because he was exchanging a service ( a report on how - to ) for a five - dollar fee .

"logic and natural language semantics esslli-99 workshop : foundations of intensional logic and natural language semantics call for papers the main focus of the european summer schools in logic , language and information is the interface between linguistics , logic and computation . it is organized under the auspices of the european association for logic , language and information ( folli ) . foundational , introductory and advanced courses together with workshops cover a wide variety of topics within six areas of interest : logic , computation , language , logic and computation , computation and language , language and logic . previous summer schools have been highly successful , attracting around 500 students from europe and elsewhere . the school has developed into an important meeting place and forum for discussion for students and researchers interested in the interdisciplinary study of logic , language and information . esslli-99 will take place at the university of utrecht , the netherlands , august 9-20 . in its first week it will feature a worskshop on foundations of intensional logic and natural language semantics . its aim is to provide a forum for advanced ph . d . students and other researchers to present and discuss their work on the following issues . intensional logic lies at the heart of a montague - style natural language semantics . it involves a representation of properties , relations and propositions ( prps ) . in traditional montague grammar , prps are characterized in terms of possible worlds , and the logico-semantic paradoxes are avoided by using a russellian hierarchy of types . the problems with this traditional approach ( e . g . , logical omniscience and expressive limitations ) have led to the flourishing of more fine - grained notions of prp , and to type-free solutions to the paradoxes ( gupta and belnap , barwise and etchemendy , cocchiarella , bealer , asher and kamp , chierchia and turner , etc . ) . the new approaches have problems of their own and no new framework has become standard . this workshop thus will explore and compare well - known or newly proposed foundational approaches for an intensional logic that can serve the purposes of natural language semantics . if you are interested in presenting your research , please send a two page abstract to : francesco orilia orilia @ unimc . it dipartimento di filosofia e scienze umane ph . + 39 ( 0733 ) 258 305 universit = e0 di macerata fax + 39 ( 0733 ) 235 339 62100 macerata italy the submission deadline is : march 15 , 1999 . workshop speakers will pay a reduced essli-99 registration fee , which will entitle them to attend all other courses and workshops . it may be possible to allocate a sum of about 100 ecu to partially cover the expenses of each workshop speaker . there will soon be an esslli ' 99 web page at : http : / / esslli . let . uu . nl / .",Safe Email

"ipa , austerlitz i learned phonetics and phonetic field technique from robert austerlitz ( 1923-1994 ) . after reading joseph stemberger 's comments on ipa and democratizing the process of standarizing phonetic writing ( in linguist 6 . 185 ) , i thought about how austerlitz taught . austerlitz never asked us to memorize ipa or any other system . instead , he taught us several different systems of notation all at once . he expected us to be able to describe sounds by place of articulation , manner of articulation , and so on . we were expected to + know + ipa , of course , and he referred us to several different sources , each of which had a slightly different version of it . but there were no standard systems in his classroom . he was a remarkable teacher and made me a fieldworker . he used a number of symbols that are rarely seen anywhere else . one of his favorites was the cardinal vowel "" 61 "" , by which ( if i remember correctly ) he meant the high back unrounded vowel written "" turned m "" in ipa . this "" 61 "" was merely the letter "" uy "" from the cyrillic alphabet . in his field-technique classes , we were encouraged to make up new symbols to describe what we heard . i remember , during a session with a speaker from shanqhae , he expressed the greatest pleasure when joseph davis wrote the initial consonant of ' cooked rice ' with a digraph made up of a "" v "" with a lowercase "" f "" planted between its arms . this expressed graphically the unusual shanqhae sound that davis had described - it was clearly a labiodental fricative , but somehow sounded both voiced and voiceless at the same time . austerlitz first mentioned that "" they "" in the ipa would say that diacritics could be used to express this , then recounted chao 's claim that many chinese dialects have initial consonants that are in-between voiced and voiceless , and went on to discuss ways that he and others had thought of to write this . actually , though , the use of those ipa voiced / voiceless or breathy voicing diacritics might not be quite right . the "" voiced "" initials in shanqhae lower register words are neither contrastively voiced nor contrastively unvoiced ; the apparent "" breathy semi-voicing "" seems actually to be feature of the + tone + , not the initials . some speakers pronounce it with the initial , some before the initial , some afterwards , some all the way through the syllable , and some not at all . davis ' symbol was a good idea at the time , though , because it expressed this lack of contrast vividly . i have met quite a number of linguists who have complaints about ipa or about the variety of systems in use , but these people hardly ever seem to be fieldworkers . i do n't believe i know any two fieldworkers who use phonetic symbols quite the same way , and most of them do n't seem to care at all . everyone seems to have different preferences ; well , so what ? some people , for instance , can't abide to write the "" h "" for aspiration + above + the line , and write it seemingly as a full segment . others leave the "" h "" out altogether , saying that ( in english , for instance ) it need not be written explicitly . the chinese tend to write aspiration with the reversed apostrophe of greek , probably continuing the tradition of older systems of romanization . the chinese , in fact , have a whole class of vowels - frictionless sibilants - that have n't made their way into ipa , as well as a special set of alveolo-palatal consonants . are these really necessary ? maybe not , but the chinese are not going to give them up ; be sure of that . for my part , i dislike plain schwa - i prefer to use the four schwa-area vowels ( close-mid and open-mid , rounded and unrounded ) that ipa now recognizes , and even before they became official i was using some of their current symbols , although i sometimes used special diacritics with schwa , too . these vowels are important in some of the areas where i work , in rural fwujiann . but every chinese dialectologist i know uses schwa like mad , and for a number of vowels that i consider quite distinct . we understand each other , though . fieldworkers are basically explorers . for the most part we do not go into the field to codify the known , but search for the unknown . we play with our symbols , try different ways of writing things , develop habits of transcription that are as distinctive as handwriting and reflect different ways of interpreting sounds . it is natural in these circumstances that different standards should take shape . fieldwork is an adventure , and transcriptional practice reflects that . i can't imagine why anyone thinks we need a single , "" democratically devised "" standard . ipa of some sort is good enough for most people who actually use it , and if someone does n't like it , he or she will borrow from some other tradition - american , perhaps - or invent another . if i want to look at that person 's notes , i will just learn the system - it might take as long as 10 minutes - and that will be that . where is the problem ? why should i trade my freedom of transcriptional expression for a rigid code ? why would that benefit me ? no , the "" chaos of multiple standards "" that stemberger mentions does n't bother me at all . there + are + two things that do bother me , though . one is the frequent changes in ipa that have been bandied about recently . when the kiel version of ipa was first promulgated , i was aghast at the large number of weird-looking symbols . then came the revision of kiel , and things were different again . i do n't mind adjustments , as long as they are introduced very gradually . like the agreement a couple of years ago that + either + way of writing "" g "" was acceptable - that only took a few decades to get straight . the idea that lots of changes have to be introduced and introduced right away frightens me a little . that is n't to say i do n't enjoy hearing the different proposals people advocate , but i will probably still stick to my own transcriptional habits , even so . the other thing that bothers me is the mob of systematizers , standardizers , formalists , and unificationists who seem to pop up everywhere in linguistics like dandelions by the side of the road . to my mind , formal systematization is the enemy of good fieldwork . and if a democratic vote + is + ever taken on the subject of phonetic alphabets , i hereby move that it be restricted to people who do a + minimum of 100 hours of fieldwork or acoustic measurement + every year for their own , fresh research . as for the rest of you - you are welcome to listen , enjoy the show , but please do n't try to tell me my business . david prager branner , yuen ren society asian l&l , do-21 , university of washington seattle , wa 98195 ( charmii @ u . washington . edu )",Safe Email

( this supports a special posting in advance . ) although it is good to have these internal procedures , what is important to the commission is that pipeline tariffs set forth specific procedures regarding the availability of capacity . the columbia order also gave guidance on when a pipeline has to accept a bid for max rates . columbia proposed that it not be required to sell capacity to shippers bidding the maximum rate for a term of less than 12 months until one day prior to the commencement of gas flow detailed in the auction package . the commission rejected this in favor of the industrials ' proposal : beginning 30 days before the capacity is available for service , columbia must accept bids at the max rate for a term of five months to less than 12 months . beginning seven days before the capacity is available , columbia must accept maximum rate bids for terms of more than one month to less tha 5 months . columbia must accept maximum rate bids for a term of one month or less one day before gas flows . thanks , maria - - - - - original message - - - - - from : hass , glen sent : wednesday , may 30 , 2001 4 : 32 pm to : harris , steven ; miller , mary kay ; fossum , drew ; dornan , dari ; pavlou , maria ; pryor , tony ; donoho , lindy ; watson , kimberly ; darveaux , mary ; fawcett , jeffery ; lokay , michelle ; lindberg , lorraine ; lohman , tk ; kirk , steve ; paladino , ranelle subject : capacity posting procedures attached for your review is a redlined draft of tw ' s capacity posting procedure including changes suggested at our meeting yesterday . one remaining item is to decide whether capacity available for "" less than 5 months "" or "" 5 months or less "" will be designated as 1 day postings . please review and advise if you have any additional comments . thanks . gh >",Safe Email

To explain what I mean:
According to the PGCC site, GCC by itself is not very good at taking 
advantage of the pipelining features introduced with the Pentium family. The 
PGCC patches are supposed to make GCC generate tighter code, but your point 
about compiler bugs is well taken. This is why I am taking things slow and 
looking into these things. As Isaid, the PGCC site does not seem to have been 
updated in at least a year or more?!? I am also looking into GCC itself. Now 
that the 3.1. series is out, it might be better than when the PGCC patches 
were written. The bottom line is, Pentiums have better instruction sets than 
the original 386 instructions that they still support. The Pentium also 
started introducing pipelining so properly generated code can be upto 30% 
faster than equivulent code that performs the same function! As for why 
optimise GCC if it will only produce that same code only slightly faster? The 
speed is based on a percentage of the total compile time. The first time I 
compiled the qt libs, with only 16M and a LOT of swap, it took over 48 hours. 
I've now got 128M in the box but at 200Mhz any increase, distributed over 
such a long compile is still considerable.> on the other side you can look into patches to gcc that affect it's

My understanding, and I've followed the development of the Intel family since 
the 8080, each generation since the 386 has introduced better and faster 
instructions. I.E.:
The 486 introduced I.E.E.E floating point instructions by incorporating an 
FPU on board. The first few generations were flaky, so Intel disabled the 
dodgy ones and sold then as 486SX, I.E. without the FPU. Later generations 
were better, this is why you only find slow 486SX's ;-) Therefore 486's, with 
working FPU's can calculate floats faster than 386's, but you must generate 
the proper codes to take advantage of this.The Pentium's improved the FPU logic and introduced pipelining. The first 
generations of Pentiums had faulty FPu logic programmed into them, the 
Pentium Bug, but subsequent ones were fine. These added instructions are 
faster again then the 486 equivulents. Also, the pipelining needs careful 
instruction ordering to take full advantage of it's speed improvements, 
again, something the compiler must know about to utilise to full effect. 
According the the PGCC site GCC does this poorly, but that info seems to be 
dated, GCC3.1.x might be better. This is one of the areas I am researching 
closely to get an answer.MMX added the ability to perform matrix calculations on int's with single 
instructions and using special DMA features within the Pentium to speed this 
up. Two problems with this:
1) int's are not very useful for most matrix calculations, floats would be 
betters.
2) this is not something that can be optimised well by a compiler. It need to 
be identified and provided for in the sources.
I.E. not much use to anyone, but makes great ad copy ;-)The PentiumPro improved the pipeline enormously. Again, a properly written 
compiler should be able to optimise for this, once it can organise the code 
properly.The PIII added MMX-type instructions for floats! Now this IS useful! 
Graphic-Intensive programs can take greate advantage of this, but it must be 
provided for in the source code. Compilers can not, usually optimise for this 
sort of thing. XFree86 and DRI are two prime examples that do provide for 
this, so the PIII can run XFree86 and DRI quite a bit faster, IF it's 
compiled for these SSE instructions!Not sure what improvements the P4 introduce? I think it's mostly just speed 
improvements rather than any execution changes.So, The difference between the 386 and the PentiumMMX 'should' yield a 
significant speed boost if optimised correctly. There are faster floating 
point instructions and pipelining that need optimising for. I'm not sure if 
GCC can optimise properly for the pipelining, at least the PGCC group found 
significant improvements to add to GCC2.95.3 to gain speed improvements of 
upto 30%. 30% of 48 hours is 14.4 hours. Of course none of this will have any 
effect on O/I bound processes but GUI's are mostly CPU bound. I am also 
finding out about object pre-linking optimisations which should give even 
better performance for QT and KDE.Now if I had another PIII for my box, I could take advantage of those SSE 
instructions to optimise XFree86 as well!> kevinAn, of course, I've loads of time on my hands now and I need something to 
keep me busy. At least I can say that I've sucessfully built a full Linux 
system, including KDE3 from scratch when I'm done ;-)

"Date:May 16,2002. 
Email:edum@hkem.com. Dear Sir, I am Mr.Eduado de Mello, one of the Principal 
Commanders of the Union for the Total Independence of 
Angola,UNITA.Well needless telling a very long story 
here for our story is indeed interwoven with the 
history of the world and the liberation struggle in 
the Southern African region of the African continent. 
The bubble burst just about some weeks ago today when my supreme 
commander, the late Dr.Jonas Savimbi was killed in an 
encounter with the government forces of the MPLA 
government of my country.The rest is now history but 
suffice it to say that I am tired of the unfortunate 
role of waging a war against my fatherland.I have 
therefore decided to pull out my troupes from the bush 
even if the other field commanders decide otherwise am 
therefore poised to effect a new beginning in my life 
and I have decided to make South Africa my new home at 
least for the interim period until I am sufficiently 
sure that I would be welcome home whole heartedly by 
the MPLA government in Luanda the capital of Angola. 
Needles to say I was the single most important 
commander who was very close to the late supreme 
commander; Dr.Jonas Savimbi.Indeed because I am a 
brother to one of his wives,he confided in me a great 
deal.The result of such trust is my reason for 
contacting you I was the commander whom he sent to 
deposit the sum of Thirty two million USD ($32million) 
with a security/finance company in South Africa.This 
was immediately after the events of September 11,2001 
in the United States of America.Indeed it had become 
increasingly difficult to move large volumes of money 
around the world particularly for a liberation 
movement like UNITA hence the recourse to keeping the 
money with the security company in South Africa. I 
have decided to inherit this money which was taken out 
and deposited with the said security/finance company 
as cash in Hundred dollar denominations.The money is 
kept in my signature and would have been used in the 
purchase of arms and ammunition for the purposes of 
continuing the civil war in Angola.The supreme 
commander is dead and as already stated I have decided 
to quite the whole thing and this is without regard to 
the fact that other commanders may wish to continue ! 
I want to cooperate with you in my decision to inherit 
the $32million.I am still in the bush here but I have 
been able to establish contact with the company in 
South Africa to the effect that I would soon come to 
take possession of the money that I kept with them. 
Note also that I deposited the money as a foreign 
national who is the head of a Mining company in Angola 
(Never as a commander of UNITA). If you are able to 
cooperate with me over this am willing to give you 20% 
of the $32million.Please come back to me through 
email: edum@hkem.com.The security/finance 
company is standing by to receive my instructions on 
this and I will link you up with them as soon as you 
are ready to take possession of the $32million. 
Finally you are to note that in you reply, you are to 
state your residential or company address and if 
possible send a copy of your international passport so 
as to assure me that my money is safe in your hands. 
Yours truly, 
Eduado de Mello _______________________________________________

Remote Viewing that the Reptoid ETs, dinosaurs and dragons are all linked

derivatives have a home planet (in the Eridanus system) like all other ETs.
The Reptoids have no reported home planet. They also come over as entities
with little brain who control their bodies directly by spirit. This is a
description of a ghost or disincarnate entity regardless of how people see
them. Thus it could be that the Reptoids, Erideans, Nordics, Anunnaki, but
not the Greys, all have origins on Earth and have a strong link to Earth
even if they choose to live elsewhere. The Greys do not appear to have a
renal or urinary system and this points to them not originating on Earth.
The definitive work on dragons is ""The Flight of Dragons"" by Peter
Dickinson. If dragons did exist in the flesh, they did not survive the long
bow. Targets do not come much bigger.Truth is stranger than fiction. Thus the writer's current scenario is that
there were a race of dinosaurs which developed psychic intelligence to guard
their eggs and young, and who probably preferred to live underground. They
survived the wipe out of the dinosaurs 50 million years ago with difficulty.
They evolved into the Erideans and transferred to a more hospitable planet
(for them) possibly with the help of another race of ETs who wanted slaves
but otherwise had no interest in Earth or mind control.Thus it appears that the current Reptoids are the Spirits or ghosts of the
dinosaurs. They must have been powerful to survive 50 million years and also
to appear to some people. They have appeared to the writer in remote
viewing. They are living on as vampire entities. Such immortal minds are
contagious and can easily jump race and species barriers. If they can be
encouraged to reincarnate, then the power sources of the black magicians and
mind controllers will disappear. Encouraging them to reincarnate will help
so called immortal minds to disappear as immortal minds have great
difficulty surviving reincarnation. Purging people's dinosaurs should remove
all perverse psychic abilities not under their control. They are a source of
Satanic Guardian Angels and demons. They control us by owning our psi. Thus
if we regain ownership of psi, we must relinquish their control and that of
all other mind controllers. Encourage people to regain ownership of their
psi.THE ORIGINS OF LOVE, HATE AND PURE MALICE. The following scenario appears to
hold water and can account for the origins of our Universal Subconscious.Dinosaurs laid their eggs and buried them either underground or in piles of
rotting vegetation (a good source of beetles and grubs for young
hatchelings). They did not sit on their eggs to keep them warm, which made
them very vulnerable to drastic climate and temperature change. In order to
keep away predators some at least developed psychic mind control. To do this
they had to capture ownership of the psi of potential predators. This is an
act of hatred and outward looking. While a few dinosaurs did develop the
ability to bear living young, most did not. The dinosaurs got in first and
so their mind control tends to override all other latter minds. They have
become the source of all Satans, devils and demons.Birds on the other hand developed the ability to sit on their eggs and keep
them warm. A hen bird normally lays a series of eggs (say one per day) and
only starts sitting when the clutch is completely laid. Thus all eggs tend
to hatch together as they all have an equal period of warmth. This is
primarily an act of love but inward looking. Bearing live young is not
suitable to a bird of the air. A pregnant pigeon would not fly very far.
Antarctic penguins tuck a single egg between their legs to keep it warm,
even if they are standing on ice.Mammals developed live bearing of their young which is also primarily an act
of love and inward looking. This is especially true as a mammalian female
can not desert her young in the womb in case of emergency as can a bird
sitting on a nest.Dinosaurs developed hate and mind control of others to protect their young,
while birds and mammals developed love. Birds and mammals certainly do hate
all enemies of their young, but this is secondary.If one wants to purge the sources of malice of say a black magician, then
purge his dinosaurs and his dinosaur eggs. Unfortunately most of our
religions are based on dinosaur protection of eggs and thus mind control,
regardless of the front they put out to the public. Religion tends to
concentrate on ""How to Brainwash your Neighbour"". Conscious thought has
built many mighty empires, theologies and slave control systems out of using
""How to care for and protect one's young"" as a foundation.Thus the foulest form of abuse possible is to call something ""A load of
dinosaur's eggs"". Purging the dinosaurs and dinosaur's eggs of any entity
tends to purge all malice back to its roots.It looks as if mighty immortal minds have built up from small beginnings,
aided and abetted by various occultists and other. As they will insist on
vampiring the living for energy to avoid reincarnation and disturbing the
serenity of the writer, he encourages them to reincarnate.ITEMS FOR INSPECTION. For mind control to take place, then someone must take
control or ownership of the target's psi and pleasure centres. Check for the
following.Nest of dinosaur's eggs, holy dinosaurs, etc.
Eggs, controllers or owners in peoples psi, pleasure centres, pain killing
hormones, abilities, etc.
Mind machines.
The original engraving or engram.
GOD and SATAN appear to be job titles and not entities in their own right. T
hey appear to be dinosaur engravings or engrams. No doubt dinosaurs were the
first job holders.
TIMETRACKS are worth investigating as our complete history from the start of
time.My, our, Man's timetracks, etc.
The time tracks of the Universe, Universal Subconscious, Galactic
Subconscious, etc.
EXTINCT RACES of ETs can cause problems when they live on in vampire mode.
Their virtues may known to channelers but they can also have vices. Whenever
one hears of races which have evolved on to higher planes, suspect that the
higher plane is a vampire one. One may never know what they looked like or
other basic characteristics, which makes linking back a trifle difficult.
Every extinct race, etc.
BLOOD ANCESTORS are also worth investigating as minds can be passed down via
genetic linkages. Some of these can be over 2,000 years old.
Every blood ancestor, ancestral mind, genetic mind, etc.

"re : 5 . 1237 sum : basic word order ( and remarks on typology ) fritz newmeyer raises some important issues about typological research as instantiated in nichols ' work and elsewhere , which call for some comments . first , the notion of language type is an idealization : this is often made clear in typology courses , where non-existent artificial languages are considered as logically possible or impossible language types , if not always in the published literature ( though the point is clearly made in comrie 's textbook , for example , by the discussion of morphological typology ) . similarly , fritz is quite right to point out that the assumption of no areal or genetic bias , to the extent that it is made at all , is a counterfactual one . what i would ask is whether such idealizations differ in kind from those , many of them counterfactual , which underlie generative grammar . the justification is similar in both cases : methodologically , one cannot deal with all the relevant variables all the time , and some of the concepts used are logically independent of the extrinsic variables , e . g . one can investigate consistency with proposed implicational universals regardless of the statistical bias in one 's sample . the term ` shaky typological pigeon-holing ' is particularly inapt as applied to nichols ' distinction between head-marking and dependent - marking languages , which is quite explicitly a matter of degree ( see her 1986 paper where the degree of hm vs . dm is quantifified in terms of the number of patterns instantiating each type ) . if nichols refers to a ` head-marking language ' this is shorthand for a quantifiable tendency , just as we might describe italian as a ` pro-drop language ' without implying that there is a binary distinction here ( in fact there are degrees of pro-drop , e . g . some languages allow null expletives but not null referential subjects , etc ) . another point which i think all typologists would accept is that languages which do n't appear to match an established type are typological data - for example , colloquial french as discussed recently on linguist is a language which might reasonably be described as having no basic word order ( i believe that nichols classified it as vso in one of her tables , but that is again shorthand for a more complex situation ) . this is an explanandum for which nichols ' 1986 paper offers an explanation : head-marking facilitates word order freedom , and colloquial french instantiates clausal head-marking in nichols ' sense . to sum up : pace widespread opinion , typologists ' goal is not pigeon-holing ( "" taxonomy "" is also widely used in this context ! ) but the investigation and explanation of patterns of variation . steve matthews",Safe Email

2. Are you still looking for a very Real Business that can provide you and
  your family with the lifestyle you desire and deserve? Or,just a second
  income in your spare time?3. Would you invest $66.50 (A 25% discount off of our regular price of
  $99.95 during this limited time promotion. ) in a business that could make you
  ""FINANCIALLY SECURE""?
If so, read on:
This is not a get rich quick scheme, but, it is a way for you to get into
  a business with a minimal investment and, may be your first step towards a
  rewarding first, or second income. For the longest time, only those, who were
  able to make large investments were able to take advantage of this type of a
  business. We have made it possible for everyone to do it, and at a price
  everyone can afford.Â Corporate America has conditioned us to believe that security comes from
  employment. Yet layoffs are hitting an all time high, major corporations are
  failing and we hope to never become the victims of this downsizing, career
  burn out, illness or injury.
There was a time, when finding another job was not a problem, but today,
  the frightening reality for a lot of people is that ""the
  plastic in their wallets determines the quality of their lives.""
The hard facts show that our economy has moved from the industrial age
  into the INFORMATION, SERVICE AND RETAIL AGE. No longer can you depend on the
  corporation to provide your family with the security you seek.

"all, I posted the below question to this list so I thought I'd update you all. Thanks for your suggestions.Well, I'd decided to bite the bullet and spend big on a new case and CPU fan.I bought a lian-li aluminum case. It was expensive as cases go (stgÂ£133.86) but I decided, it's a good basis to build any future PC on. It has 4 x 51/4"" drive bays and 6 x 3Â½"" drive bays so I should be ok for future upgrades etc. I have to say it was worth it. Its a pleasure to work on. It has a slide out tray to mount the Mother Board on, both sides come off, the drive bays come out...all without using a screwdriver (thumb screws). Even the edges inside the case are smooth so no banging your hands off shape edges etc. There are 4 fans inside the case, which can be set to 3 different speeds. There are 4 usb ports on the front of the box too. The box is big and has loads of room inside. Oh... and it looks very cool :-)However there are 2 things to look out for. On the Maplins website it says* Up to three 80mm case fans can be fitted! * ATX Power supply sold separatelyIn fact the case came with 4 fans and a power supply, which is great but I ordered 2 fans and a power supply separately. Also the case was a slightly different model to one advertised, as I got the USB model. It does say (Product may vary in design and specification from that show) but I missed that :-)I also bought a Flower Cooler Kit which is completely silent. Very nice.

"re : var for credit trading ted thanks for the note - coming from jpmorgan i understand the importance of var as a key control measure and i appreciate that we may all need to do further work to ' institutionalise ' a var culture in enron . however , in this instance , i believe the initial comment has been taken out of context . i believe there is a general communication issue here . since inception the business has been monitoring risk via the use of a cumulative sensitivity measure for the portfolio - expressed and reported as dvolon the daily dpr . however , no - one in rac / commercial / commercial support appears to have formally equated that sensitivity to the business var limit during the longer than expected delay to the completion of a signed off var model . ( informally this is being done ) i would have expected the business to utilise a crude ( and possibly necessarily overstated ) scaling factor based on the volatility of credit spread movements in the market and for rac to have signed off this scaling factor . bryan seyfield and david wall will propose this immediately . finally , i believe both commercial and commercial support for credit trading are reprioritising the work being completed for the model for var reporting - we should communicate the new delivery date as soon as possible . i look forward to discussing this and other rac / commercial support interface issues with you next week regards mike from : ted murphy 26 / 06 / 2000 14 : 50 to : sally beck / hou / ect @ ect , mike jordan / lon / ect @ ect , fernley dyson / lon / ect @ ect , bryan seyfried cc : rick buy , richard causey / corp / enron @ enron subject : re : var for credit trading please see the attached comment at the bottom of this string of e - mails . the privilege of using enron ' s balance sheet comes with the responsibility to adequately report the risk in the form that has been agreed to . it is appalling to me that we are currently incapable of calculating var in a product that has been approved for trading for several months . it is equally appalling that the support staff continues to be so unaware of the importance of this that the comments below could even be considered reasonable . obviously , the individual who made the comment is hardly responsible . it lies with both commercial and commercial support management . i know that airing this out in such a broad way appears to be harsh . this is not the point . this is not an isolated problem . it is not just pertaining to europe . please do not feel singled out . but the scrutiny and pressure on var as a measure of risk continues to grow at fast pace . we can hardly make any progress if this is the pervasive attitude . let ' s knock this stuff out one at a time . ted oliver gaylard 06 / 26 / 2000 08 : 34 am to : david port / market risk / corp / enron @ enron cc : chris abel / hou / ect @ ect , michael e moscoso / hou / ect @ ect , david a wall / risk mgmt / lon / ect @ ect , ted murphy / hou / ect @ ect subject : re : var for credit trading the var engine for credit trading is being built by research in london and it is intended that var be run daily as soon as they have produced / signed off on this . oliver from : david port @ enron 26 / 06 / 2000 14 : 24 to : chris abel / hou / ect @ ect cc : michael e moscoso / hou / ect @ ect , david a wall / risk mgmt / lon / ect @ ect , oliver gaylard / lon / ect @ ect , ted murphy / hou / ect @ ect subject : re : var for credit trading my view : prove its insignificant by calculating it every day , that ' s why the board approved the limit . dp chris abel @ ect 06 / 23 / 2000 07 : 41 am to : david port / market risk / corp / enron @ enron cc : michael e moscoso / hou / ect @ ect subject : var for credit trading fyi - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - forwarded by chris abel / hou / ect on 06 / 23 / 2000 07 : 38 am - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - mary thambiah 06 / 23 / 2000 03 : 29 am to : chris abel / hou / ect @ ect cc : david a wall / risk mgmt / lon / ect @ ect subject : var for credit trading hi chris i talked with david yesterday and we don ' t think the risk is significant enough to start calculating a var number . however if you have any queries feel free to give him a call . rgds mary",Safe Email
"california update - 10 / 02 / 2001 for questions or comments regarding this report please contact g . britt whitman at ex : 5 - 4014 or kristin walsh at ex : 3 - 9510 . executive summray ? cpuc settles filed rate doctrine case with socal ? cpuc kills dwr rate agreement , davis may reconsider old senate bill cpuc - socal suit in a closed hearing today , the california public utilities commission voted 5 - 0 to settle its filed rate doctrine case with socal edison . the implications could save socal from an otherwise immanent bankruptcy , though bankruptcy remains a real threat . under the agreement , the cpuc has stipulated the following points , which have not yet been formalized by administrative law judge , ronald lew : ? the cpuc agrees to maintain a level of rates necessary for socal to pay off under - collect through 2003 . ? all surplus revenue ( revenue above o & m ) generated from any source must be applied to socal ' s back debt . ? socal agrees to pay no dividends on its common stock from now until 2003 , or until all back debt has been recovered . if socal ' s debt has not been recovered by 2003 , the cpuc will extend appropriate rates levels necessary for socal to recover its debt through 2004 . dividend payouts on socal common stock will be subject to cpuc approval during this extension . ? 100 % of any revenue socal receives / generates from ferc / generator refunds will be applied to socal ' s debt . ? once socal ' s back debt has been recovered , any surplus revenue generated from the cpuc rate hikes will be refunded to ratepayers . cpuc - dwr rate agreement the fact that the puc voted down the dwr rate agreement ( by a 4 - 1 margin ) puts governor davis and treasurer angelides in a very awkward position . this leaves senator burton ' s bill , sb 18 xx , as the vehicle that sets to payment path for the revenue bonds to repay the general fund . however , as late as this morning , governor davis vowed ( through his spokesman ) that sb 18 xx was "" dead on arrival "" and would be vetoed . this move by the puc puts pressure on davis to sign sb 18 xx in order to protect the bonds and the long - term power contacts he has negotiated . however , 18 xx violates the terms of a number of the long - term power contacts negotiated by the governor earlier this year . for example : ? sb 18 xx splits the revenue streams for payment of the general fund ' s revenue bonds and payment to the dwr for power . it clarifies the funds that will go to repay the general fund , but is much less clear on the funds to pay the dwr for power . sb 18 xx leaves the long - term contracts signed by the governor open to review and renegotiation - something that the governor remains publicly unwilling to do . ? sb 18 xx also violates the terms of the bridge loan the state negotiated with shearson lehman earlier this year . the terms of the bridge loan explicitly state that if 18 xx is passed , the banks can accelerate the loan or impose penalty terms of interest on the state . these terms were suggested by the governor as a means of forcing the legislature to support his dwr rate agreement rather than burton ' s . of course , this effort failed when the legislature easily passed sb 18 xx . today ' s puc action further complicates the situation . while on the surface this would seem to force the governor ' s hand into signing sb 18 xx , that may not , in fact , happen . it would not be out of character for the governor to instead veto sb 18 xx , then force either the legislature or the puc to "" play ball "" with him in order to repay the general fund . thus , another leverage point has been created . we will continue to monitor the situation to attempt to determine the likelihood of davis signing or vetoing sb 18 xx .",Safe Email

  | Um, my test was to tee to a fifo I didn't read from... resulting
  | in the other reader hanging around forever.... not realising that
  | never-opened-for-reading and opened-and-later-closed might be
  | different. ah!  yes!  this is one of those gotchas everyone stumbles
 over.  the writer of a never-opened-for-reading pipe will
 quickly block (as soon as the pipe's limited buffer fills
 up).  but the writer of opened-and-later-closed pipe gets
 an EPIPE error (and the usually-terminal SIGPIPE signal). the typical stumble is someone creates an anonymous pipe
 with pipe(2), but forgets to close(2) the reader's fd in
 the writer-process (or visa-versa) .... and then wonders
 why the real reader never sees an EOF and/or the writer
 is never gets an EPIPE/SIGPIPE.  various FAQs and many
 books probably discuss this topic in depth to the death.  |             Sensible behaviour has now been observed. good!  and good luck.
cheers,

many suggestions from Dive Into Accessibility[1], a book which was written in 
and is still powered by Movable Type. I find this amusing in a self-referential 
sort of way. The other big change is the inclusion of MT-search to allow users to have their 
own site search. Every web site needs a site search[2]. Existing MT-search 
users should merge the contents of mt-search.cfg into mt.cfg, change 
""TemplateDir"" to ""SearchTemplatePath"", and (if you use alternate templates) 
change ""AltTemplate1"", ""AltTemplate2"", ""AltTemplate3"", etc. to ""AltTemplate"". 
They should all just be ""AltTemplate"". - Download MT 2.5[3].

YOUR KIND ATTN.,RE: REQUEST FOR MUTUALLY BENEFITTING ENDEAVOUR.I humbly crave your indulgence in sending you this
mail, if the contents does not meet with your personal
and business ethics, I apologize in advance.I am Barrister Kola Owolabi( attorney at law), I
represent Alhaji Ishmaila Ibrahim Gwarzoâ€™s estates. Alhaji Gwarzo was the chief
security advicer of the then military leader of this country(Nigeria) in the
person of Late General Sani Abacha who died on the 8th of June 1998. With the
advent of a new democratic
dispensation in the country under the leadership of
Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo (Rtd), my client has come under
severe persecution due to the sensitive position he
held in the last military regime, presently he is
under house arrest restricted only to the confines of
his village.The main purpose of this mail is to intimate you of a
business proposal that might be of interest to you. My
client has informed me of the existence of funds
deposited with a security company abroad. This fund
came about as part of security votes that were
allocated to my client's portfolio during his tenure
as chief security adviser to the then president. What
happened was that he had part of the funds transferred
from the vaults of the Central Bank Of Nigeria to this
security outfit with the aim of purchasing arms and ammunitions for the personal
security outfit of the
then president. But before the purchase could take
place the president died. My client has decided to
keep this for himself as all his properties has been
confisticated by the present regime. But due to his
incarceration he cannot travel out and effect the
change of possession to his benefit.I have been mandated by my client to source for a
foreign partner that can help him facilitate the
change of possession. The deposit certificate and the
code needed for the execution of this endeavor are in
my possession.The funds in question is USD17.6M (Seventeen Million, Six Hundred Thousand
United States dollars Only). Should this proposition be of interest to you, you can reach me through my e-mail address so that we can go through the rudiments of this endeavor.I remain most obliged.Barrister Kola Owolabi(JP).

Cable companies cracking down on Wi-FiBroadband providers are cracking down on popular Wi-Fi networks, threatening to cut service to customers who set up the inexpensive wireless systems and allow others to freely tap into their Internet access.
Time Warner Cable of New York City has given 10 customers less than a week to stop using their accounts to provide a wireless local area network available to anyone within 300 feet. The letters are just an initial volley; Time Warner expects to send additional letters, while AT&T Broadband also is preparing similar letters for some of its customers.

The plug-in will, tex9 promises, allow drag-and-drop access to iPod, which holds up to 10GB of music.

with DVD+R and DVD+RW. (Confused yet?) Unfortuantely these tools don't

"comparative method the recent discussion of limitations on the comparative method contained several assertions that such limitations had been and were being used to justify resistance to proposals of remote relationships , including amerind and nostratic . to my knowledge this is absolutely false . in every instance that i am aware of in which perceived temporal limitations on the comparative method have been mentioned , it is by way of explaining why it is there are no relationships beyond a certain degree of remoteness on which there is consensus , or by way of making predictions as to what historical linguistics will ultimately be able to achieve . i do not know of a single instance in which someone has argued : such and such a proposed relationship is associated with a time-depth of x years . this exceeds the temporal limits of the comparative method . therefore the proposal must be wrong . if anyone can provide evidence of such an argument being made i would be most interested . in the particular case of amerind , the objections have been two-fold : ( a ) the data is riddled with errors ; ( b ) the argument is not of a sort that most historical linguists consider probative . since greenberg and ruhlen do not apply the comparative method disbelief in their claims could not rationally be based on perceived limitations of the comparative method , nor has it been . ironically , even if greenberg and ruhlen did attempt to apply the comparative method , amerind would not provide a very good instance of the above hypothetical argument . since even conservative estimates of the time-depth possible with the comparative method range from 6-10ky , cand since greenberg and ruhlen adhere to the low chronology for the peopling of the americas that places it at roughly 12ky bp , their date for amerind does not radically exceed the perceived limits of the comparative method . in sum , whatever the validity of proposed temporal limits on the comparative method , and i agree that such limits are far from exact , the view that this has anything to do with reactions to greenberg 's work on amerind and similar work is a red-herring . to evaluate such proposals , look at the data and look at the methodology , not at the alleged ( and generally unknowable ) motivations of the critics . you 'd think that the irrelevance of ad hominem arguments except in matters of credibility of witnesses would not need to be repeated constantly . bill poser bill poser , first nations studies , university of northern british columbia , 3333 university way , prince george , british columbia , v2n 4z9 , canada 604-960 - 6692",Safe Email

"confirmcorp info see the comment below on williams ' confirmation site . sounds similar to what we are proposing on cl . one question i ' m exploring right now is whether we could save more money from an enron perspective and achieve greater marketability with the model that confirmcorp proposes with automated matching vs . the commodity logic / williams approach that depends on users reviewing / approving confirms ( we ' ve simply put the current process online so to speak ) . we need to push for a more radical change / improvement on a faster timeline . i still believe confirms is the correct area to be focusing on , as i mentioned in our meeting with louise , but we need to seriously review what we propose to deliver and how . is confirmcorp a viable company to bring under the enron umbrella ? i think we should be concerned that late entry with less functionality will erode our ability to sign up customers . i don ' t think each large marketer will want to log in to several sites to clear their confirmations with each of their large counterparties . can we find out if williams has further plans for their service that would compete with commodity logic ? - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - forwarded by mary solmonson / hou / ect on 11 / 07 / 2000 03 : 08 pm - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - "" chris papousek "" on 11 / 07 / 2000 11 : 10 : 15 am please respond to to : cc : subject : confirmcorp info dear ron : i recently sent you information relating to confirmcorp via fedex . i trust you have received it by now . if you have any questions , please do not hesitant to call . i will follow up with you in one week . regards , chris papousek president , confirmation clearing corporation ( 713 ) 526 - 3000 ps williams energy just came out with "" williams customerfirst "" , a website that contains all their confirmations . while eliminating faxes , this puts the onus of verification on the counterparty and assumes there is a confirmation staff on the other end to do the checkout . confirmcorp will make even this advanced approach obsolete .",Safe Email

"sle 31 call for papers , sle 31 , st andrews , scotland , 26-30 august 1998 workshop on modality in generative grammar the description and analysis of modality is of central interest to the study of human language . modality interacts with many subsystems of syntax and a better understanding of modality would further our understanding of these subsystems greatly . the relevant subsystems play a role in the existing analyses of the epistemic-deontic dichotomy . this has been attributed to : ( i ) argument structure ( e . g . ross 1969 ) : epistemic modals are one-place predicates ( corresponding to raising verbs syntactically ) , whereas deontic modals are two-place predicates ( corresponding to control verbs syntactically ) . ( ii ) insertion position : epistemic modals are generated in i , deontic modals in v ( e . g . picallo 1990 ) . ( iii ) lf position : epistemic modals are in c , deontic modals in vp ( e . g . mcdowell 1987 ) . ( iv ) nature of the complement of a modal : a definite verbal complement with epistemic modals and an indefinite verbal complement with deontic modals ( e . g . barbiers 1995 ) . v ) pragmatics : the dichotomy is contextually determined and does not correspond to a syntactic difference ( kratzer 1989 ) . many questions still need to be answered before a sufficiently adequate analysis can be developed . as for argument structure , it should be asked what evidence we have that each modal has two different argument structures . if such evidence exists , are these argument structures represented in the lexicon , as in theta-theoretic accounts , or only syntactically ? related questions concern the categorial status of modals ( a special category aux in english , but main verbs in german and dutch ) , the selectional restrictions they impose on their complement ( semantically uniform , but not syntactically : only verbal complements in english , no categorial restrictions in dutch , verbal and certain prepositional complements in german and afrikaans ) . as for their syntactic position at surface structure or lf , we need to know more about the ( scopal ) interaction of modals with negation . it is clear that there is a tight connection between modality and negation / affirmation : many languages have a modal that behaves as an negative polarity item ( english ` need ' , german ` brauchen ' , dutch ` hoeven ' ) . a related issue is the interaction of modals with focus particles , especially those that have a negative or affirmative import , such as english ` only ' or french ` bien ' . it seems that such focus particles can alter the syntactic and semantic behaviour of modals . the ( scopal ) interaction of modals with other quantifiers and modals with question operators is also in need of a better description and analysis . it has been claimed that question formation and epistemic modality exclude each other . although this does not seem to hold in general , question formation and epistemic modality do seem to restrict each other in ways that are poorly understood . the interaction of modal verbs with modal adverbials is also relevant for the determination of the syntactic position of modals , particulary in view of cinque 's ( 1997 ) hypothesis that every sentence contains two modal projections that must be either filled by a modal adverbial in the specifier or by a modal verb in the head . many languages have a construction with ` have to ' or ` be to ' that involves a modal interpretation . such constructions do not generally have an epistemic interpretation ( but consider english ` he was never to see her again ' , dutch ` het is te verwachten dat . . . ' ` it is to be expected that . . . ' ) . there are a great many cross-linguistic peculiarities on this point , which are worth exploring . for example , one question is how this type of construction , lacking a visible modal element , yields a modal interpretation . there is a more general question concerning modality : which properties of modals are necessary for modality and which are accidental ? cross - linguistically , modals often have a irregular present tense inflection paradigm . it is unclear whether this is a necessary property of modals and if so , why . the fact that english modals are auxilaries but modals in other languages are not is presumably an accidental property , and so is the fact that english modals lack infinitives and participles in their paradigm , whereas dutch modals do have infinitival and participial forms ( except for the verb ` zullen ' ` will ' ) . as it seems that the bulk of generative studies of modality involves germanic languages , we particularly invite papers on modality in romance and central european languages . organizers : sjef barbiers ( leiden ) , frits beukema ( leiden ) , olga tomic ( novi sad ) , milena milojevic sheppard ( ljubljana ) , marija golden ( ljubljana ) . please submit abstract ( 1 a4 max ) to : professor olga miseska tomic bulevar avnoja 109 / iii , stan 16 beograd yu 11070 yugoslavija e - mail : efilb01 @ yubgss21 . bg . ac . yu & dr sjef barbiers hil / department of dutch studies p . n . van eyckhof 3 leiden , nl 2300 ra the netherlands e - mail : barbiers @ rullet . leidenuniv . nl & dr frits beukema hil / department of english p . n . van eyckhof 4 leiden , nl 2300 ra the netherlands e - mail : beukema @ rullet . leidenuniv . nl closing date for submission of abstract : 15 may 1998 date of acceptance / rejection of abstract : 1 july 1998",Safe Email

Date: Not suppliedBen Hammersley posts a parable about design specifications, showing the link 
between Roman Chariots and the Space Shuttle. It has the ring of something 
apocraphyl to me, but it's a good read, nevertheless.     The U.S. standard railroad gauge (distance between the rails) is 4 feet, 
    8.5 inches. That is an exceedingly odd number. Why was that gauge used? 
    Because that's the way they built them in England, and the U.S. railroads 
    were built by English expatriates.     Why did the English build them that way? Because the first rail lines were 
    built by the same people who built the pre-railroad tramways, and that's 
    the gauge they used.     Why did ""they"" use that gauge? Because the people who built the tramways 
    used the same jigs and tools that they used for building wagons, which used 
    that wheel spacing.     So why did the wagons have that particular odd spacing? Well, if they tried 
    to use any other spacing, the wagon wheels would break on some of the old, 
    long distance roads in England, because that was the spacing of the wheel 
    ruts... Snopes says it's false[1], but from their notes, it appears that it's actually 
largely true, albeit subject to interpretation. Link[2] Discuss[3][1] http://www.snopes.com/history/american/gauge.htm

"are most people bilingual ? - - summary a few days ago i inquired about estimates of what portion of the world 's human population is bilingual . one motive i had in asking was to be able to "" shame "" my students into taking their language study seriously . "" be a mainstream human being ! "" , i would exhort them . i thank michael brody , eva fernandez , jussi karlgren , and ruth kearns for their informative replies ( insofar as there is information to be had on this topic ) . see reference list below . the authors point out that one problem with this question is the difficulty of defining "" bilingual "" , since most people so described are not equally proficient in both languages . some key excerpts follow : romaine ( 1995 : 8 ) : "" there are about thirty times as many languages as there are countries . this entails ( sic ) the presence of bilingualism in practically every country of the world . grosjean ( 1982 : vii ) estimates that about half the world 's population is bilingual . there are , however , no really precise figures on the number and distribution of speakers of two or more languages . "" grosjean ( 1982 : 2 ) : "" it is an interesting fact that no really precise statistics exist concerning the number and distribution of speakers of two or more languages .

"" end of quotations . you may remember that i asked if there were any _ principled _ estimates , and , so far as i can tell , the authors say little about the bases or reasoning behind their estimates . ruth kearns points out that "" estimates tend to come from the statistics on numbers of languages spoken in various countries and statisitics of population size in those countries . "" for me , it remains a wide-open question . jussi karlgren expressed an interesting hunch , "" . . . that the number of languages spoken has an inverse correlation with the average schooling of the general population in the area .

"amta workshop on embedded mt systems - cfp workshop announcement - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - workshop on embedded mt systems call for papers design , construction , and evaluation of systems with an mt component wednesday , october 28 , 1998 ( preceding the amta 98 conference ) sheraton bucks county hotel , langhorne , pennsylvania introduction as the strengths and weaknesses of machine translation ( mt ) engines have become better understood and accepted , there has been a marked increase in the development of computer systems with anembedded mt component . one consequence of this shift to "" embedded mt "" is that researchers , developers , as well as users have begun pushing the limits on the input that such systems will accept for translation . in so doing , a new class of problems has surfaced : any input - - - whether it appears in physical form on paper , in electronic form on-line , or mixed in with another modality such as graphics or video - - - will bring with it some unknown mix of noisy natural language data as well as non-linguistic data . how are systems with an mt component to be designed and evaluated given the challenge this input brings ? the objective of this workshop is to examine and evaluate techniques for adjusting this "" linguistic impedance mismatch "" between the real-world input and the natural language input expected by various mt engines . thus the workshop will focus on computational approaches to preprocessing system input for mt engines andon statistical methods for evaluating systems with an embedded mt component . linguistic preprocessing in image data for researchers working with image data , there is currently underway an effort to augment ocr ( optical character recognition ) engines with linguistic data as they recognize and convert bitmap data into characters - - - similar to what has already been done in speech recognition with linguistic data in hmms ( hidden markov models ) . other ocr researchers have also experimented with image-level early topic detection using word-shape recognition . in principle , this could provide a first-step filtering of documents into a more homogeneous mt input set , a desirable goal for mt evaluation . thus we expect that individuals working with or intending to incorporate ocr into their computer systems will be interested in this new area . linguistic preprocessing in online data for those working with online input , even though the characters are already present , there often still remains the task of preprocessing meaningful , symbolic character strings that are not a part of the text to be translated . for some systems , the rules for identifying and encapsulating or removing such strings may need to be hand-crafted over time as mt engine limitations surface . for others , a combination of hand-crafted rules and statistically trained nl models has worked . many have observed that the html annotations , alphanumeric items , spreadsheet and word processing codes are harder to weed out than originally expected . research efforts with the low-density and less-commonly taught languages , as well as more common ones , encounter a substantial problem with variation in spelling conventions and transcription preferences . for those natural languages that are primarily spoken and not written , for example , this is frequently the case . researchers working on this class of problem have built variants on spell checkers ( sc ) , components that standardize words to one orthography ( spelling convention ) before submitting it to an mt engine . an idea that has arisen for this component is to build in an option to adjust the level of sc correction - - - as would be relevant when input after ocr nonetheless varies from very noisy to relatively clean . evaluation of embedded mt systems among those working on statistical methods for evaluating systems with an embedded mt component , we have seen two distinct trends . one group of statisticians has begun looking for appropriate models from outside the world of mt evaluation , examining the efforts by others to take distinct metrics for components and combine them for an overall system-level metric using fuzzy mathematics . another group of researchers is looking instead at developing a one-dimensional scale for ranking mt engines along a continuum defined by system-level function . that approach , for example , might rank one engine as good enough for filtering documents , while another engine deemed more linguistically robust would be ranked higher because it could generate a good enough initial translation for subsequent post-editing . we welcome other functional evaluations of mt components and computer systems with embedded mt components as well . submissions submitters are invited to send in a short paper , not more than 5 pages , addressing one or more of the three areas discussed above . papers should define the problem in an embedded mt system that is the focus of the work , describe the embedded mt system design ( a simple sketch ) with sample input data where relevant , and present their approach to the problem . work at various stages of completion is acceptable ; we expect the current status of the work to be made clear . submission of end-to - end output of an embedded mt system is especially encouraged . the papers will be collected and distributed to participants of theworkshop . ideally , the result of the workshop will be a clearer delineation of : ( 1 ) the range of linguistic preprocessing problems ( 2 ) the range of designs in embedded mt systems ( 3 ) how these problems aretreated in different embedded mt systems and ( 4 ) the metrics that are being used to evaluate these systems and their components . dates notice of interest in participation : july 10 , 1998 ( to voss @ arl . mil ) please identify which of the three areas you intend to address : preprocessing in image data , preprocessing in online data , evaluation of embedded mt systems . position paper submission : august 10 , 1998 notifications : september 10 , 1998 final copies of papers : october 10 , 1998 workshop : october 28 , 1998 submissions may be in printed or electronic form . submissions should be sent to : clare voss army research laboratory amsrl-is -

"http://www.irishnews.com/access/daily/current.asp?SID=421083Loo rolls of honour and the invisible manPaper Clips: A round-up of the weekly pressBy Steven McCafferyThe powers-that-be tell us that crime does not pay. And they found an 
ally in the Ulster Herald this week, which carries a cautionary tale 
for anyone thinking of embarking on a criminal career. The 
Omagh-based paper's 'As the Man Says' column brings a story which 
originated in the Middle East.""A gent recently attempted to rob a bank in Tehran,"" the columnist reports.""He was unarmed and began seizing bank notes from customers' hands.""It is then explained: ""He had paid Â£625 to a local sorcerer and 
believed that he was invisible.""In the Lurgan Mail there was also news of a dramatic robbery.""A Lurgan newsagent has told how thieves drilled their way through 
three walls to steal Â£10,000 worth of cigarettes recently in an 
attack which was well planned and professional,"" the paper reports.""The thieves broke through the back wall of a religious gifts shop 
next door to the newsagents and then drilled through the partition 
between the back hallway and the front shop.""Moving statues of religious icons out of the way, the gang then 
drilled into the back of the newsagent's cigarette stand removing the 
contents.""The owner of the Paper Chase shop is pictured next to the gaping hole 
left in his store and is quoted as saying: ""On Monday morning when my 
wife was opening, everything looked normal.""But when she opened the shutters she found herself looking into the 
shop next door.""The paper reports that the shop was the target of ""another well 
organised crime"" 12 weeks ago when thieves escaped with a safe.The shop's owner says: ""The closer it gets to Christmas the more 
people are going to be open to this.""The issues of crime and punishment are tackled by a columnist in the 
Down Democrat.Writing in the Downpatrick-based newspaper John Coulter calls on the 
authorities to ""birch the vandals"" plaguing the local community.He is shocked at reports of the ""wanton destruction by vandals"" and 
issues a call for action.""The time has come to fight fire with fire,"" he writes, ""before 
unemployed paramilitaries decide to impose vigilante rule and start 
using so-called kangaroo courts to dish out their own brand of 
sentences on those found 'guilty' of anti-social behaviour.""As an alternative to such reckless violence, he recommends, 
controlled violence.""It was a sorry day that the Manx authorities banned the use of the 
birch as a weapon in dealing with unruly elements of the Isle of Man.""Getting his defence in early, he immediately rounds on any woolly 
liberal who may oppose his plan.""In many Islamic countries, public flogging of convicted criminals is 
the order of the day.""You might laugh and say there is little chance of such measures 
being introduced in the United Kingdom or Ireland given that corporal 
punishment was abolished in the vast majority of northern schools in 
the late 1980s.""However, people seem to forget that Islam is the fastest growing 
faith on the British mainland and it's only a matter of time before 
it numerically passes Christianity.""

"the evaluation of parsing systems - workshop call for papers the evaluation of parsing systems a workshop jointly organised by the cec language engineering 1 projects sparkle and ecran to be held at the first international conference on language resources and evaluation granada , spain , 26 may 1998 this workshop will provide a forum for researchers interested in the development and evaluation of natural language grammars and parsing systems , and in the creation of syntactically annotated reference corpora . organisers : john carroll , roberto basili , nicoletta calzolari , robert gaizauskas , gregory grefenstette workshop scope and aims the aim of this workshop is to provide a forum for discussion of evaluation methods for parsing systems , and proposals for the development of syntactically annotated language resources . with increased attention to evaluation of component technology in language engineering , evaluation of parsing systems is rapidly becoming a key issue . numerous methods have been proposed and while one , the parseval / penn treebank scheme , has gained wide usage , this has to some extent been due to the absence of workable alternatives rather than to whole-hearted support . parseval / ptb evaluation has several limitations and drawbacks , including a commitment to a particular style of grammatical analysis , and oversensitivity to certain innocuous types of misanalysis while failing to penalise other common types of more serious mistake . also , the original published description of the scheme - - and the evaluation software widely distributed as a follow-up to it - - is specific to the english language . it may be that there are currently no alternative more workable schemes or proposals , but this needs to be more fully discussed : this workshop will provide an opportunity for such a debate . this workshop is particularly timely given the large number of cec language engineering projects that involve parsing in one form or another and which need to evaluate and share the results of their efforts . parsing is an essential part of many larger applications , such as information extraction , which have gained in importance over the last few years . often in such systems , the strength of the parser and grammar has a direct effect on the desired results , and thus achieving good results rests on being able to determine and improve weaknesses in the parser / grammar . without a reliable parser evaluation method this cannot be done effectively . a parsing evaluation workshop is also appropriate at this time given the imminent creation of large-scale syntactically annotated resources for european languages . contributions from those involved in such activities are welcomed , so as to improve communication between the resource construction and the resource utilisation communities . this should ensure that the resources constructed are maximally useful to the general language engineering community . the organisation of this workshop brings together two european language engineering projects which are closely related and whose partners share similar research interests : sparkle and ecran . the organisers solicit contributions from the general community on the following topics : - descriptions of generic syntactic annotation schemes - methodologies and metrics for parsing system evaluation - reports and analyses of the results of utilising particular parser evaluation schemes - description / analysis / experience of language-dependent ( especially for languages other than english ) and task-dependent syntactic annotation schemes programme committee roberto basili gregory grefenstette ted briscoe mark hepple nicoletta calzolari tony mcenery john carroll maria teresa pazienza roberta catizone paola velardi robert gaizauskas yorick wilks paper submission papers should not exceed 4000 words or 10 pages . submission may be in either hard copy or electronic form . the submission deadline is february 15th , 1998 . hard copy submission : three copies of the paper should be sent to : dr john carroll cognitive and computing sciences university of sussex brighton bn1 9qh uk electronic submission : electronic submission may be in either self-contained latex , postscript , or rtf formats , to john . carroll @ cogs . susx . ac . uk . for each submission -

       Socijalisticka partija Srbije, predvodjena grupom starih socijalista na celu sa Milomirem Minicem, konacno se odrekla politike i herojskog drzanja predsednika te stranke Slobodana Milosevica, saopstenjima, da jedan ,,slabo obavesten covek ne moze, pogotovu ne iz zatvorske celije upravljati tako velikom partijom kao sto je Socijalisticka partija Srbije, pa zvao se on i Slobodan Milosevic''.
       Socijalisti koji za sebe danas kazu da vise nisu idolopoklonici Slobodana Milosevica, neprestano, u kontaktima sa clanovima i simpatizerima te partije, pokusavaju da razdvoje odbranu Slobodana Milosevica u Hagu, od politickog zivota u Srbiji, pripisujuci Milosevicevim braniocima iz nacionalnog komiteta za oslobadjanje S. Milosevica, ,,Sloboda'' da im je cilj da uniste Socijalisticku partiju Srbije.
        Iako je zbog istih takvih gledista, svojevremeno najpolularniji socijalista, posle predsednika te stranke, prof. Branislav Ivkovic bio iskljucen iz redova SPS, danas rukovodstvo SPS koristi jos teze i grublje kvalifikacije na racun njihovog predsednika, pritom ne strahujuci da bi bilo ko od njih mogao biti iskljucen iz partije.
        Ne retko se poslednjih dana, u rokovodstvu partije cuje da partija nije Slobodan Milosevic, i da on ne predstvalja tu partiju, vec da su partija Rukovodstvo i Glavni odbor te stranke.
        Medjutim u clanstvu i medju simpatizerima te stranke, stvari se ne odijaju bas po planovima rukovodstva.
        Procene idu dotle da se na septembarskim izborima ocekuje da Bata Zivojinovic osvoji tek 1% glasova.  Clanovi partije, najveci deo njih i danas veruje svom heroju, Slobodanu Milosevicu.
        Po clanstvu partije, ovih dana u rukovodstvu partije, oni koji su predsednika te stranke pogresno informisali poslednjih godina, kada su shvatili da im je ,,odzvonilo'' pokusavaju da sacuvaju sebe eliminacijom predsednika Slobodana Milosevica.
        Mladi socijalisti, kojih i nema bas mnogo, kako se SPS svojevremeno hvalio, izgleda su na strani predsednika te stranke. Tako se u nastupima na opstinskim odborima, mogu cuti uverljivi govori Dejana Stjepanovica i Igora Raicevica, i po neki Milinka Isakovica iz redova mladih socijalista, clanova organizaciono politickog odbora predsednika SPS. 
        Obracanja ovih mladih ljudi, medju clanstvom partije imaju do deset puta vecu tezuni, nego li obracanja profesionalnih politicara koji za sobom vuku teret proslosti.
         Stav rukovodstva mladih socijalista, se razlikuje od stava saveta mladih, koji su takodje na strani predsednika. 
         Branko Ruzic i Dejan Backovic, svojevremeno najveci branioci i zastupnici lika i dela Slobodana Milosevica, danas su se pretvorili u njegove najvece kriticare. Pokusavaju na sve moguce nacine da minorizuju grupu mladih koja ga podrzava.
         Cak se poslednjih dana cuje, da je najbolji recept da se rukovodstvo mladih odrzi ikao je protiv Sloba, da se povezu rodbinskim vezama, pa se tako predsednik mladih socijalista Beograda, Ana Djurovic udala za Branka Ruzica, predsednika Mladih socijalista Srbije, koji je za kuma uzeo Dejna Backovia, svog potpredsednika. Backovic se ovih dana zeni, jednom  mladom socijalistkinjom koja je clan saveta mladih, a u isto vreme i sestra jednog od clanova IO GO SPS-a, za kuma uzima jos jednog mladog socijalistu iz Saveta mladih. Sve u svemu, mladi u SPS se drze kao italijanske mafijaske porodice 60-tih u SAD.
          Sta ce se do kraja price dogoditi ostaje pitanje, no clanstvo i simpatizeri ce oceniti rad svog rukovodstva na predsednickim izborima.
          Pimato se samo, sta ce da rade, ako im Bata prodje losije od Seselja koga je predsednik Slobodan Milosevic podrzao za predsednickog kandidat?_______________________________________________________________________

"re : potential gas system exposure i agree with your concerns . i didn ' t go into all the specifics previously because of the audience of the e - mail . this is the intended procedure for use of the dummy account : both the east and the west load gas books into the enpower system nightly ( this is not one person ' s responsibility but the entire group ' s responsibility ) . previously , the only message we get for this load is a success that all the books went somewhere in enpower with the installation of the new ' dummy ' account , the message will now tell us if one of the books was loaded to this ' dummy ' account if an eol bridge mistakenly puts gas deals in a power gas book that was not correctly mapped , the position would go to the ' dummy ' account if an eol bridge mistakenly puts gas deals in a power gas book that was correctly mapped , the position would show up in that trader ' s gas positions depending on which load ( east or west ) has a book that was mapped to the ' dummy ' account will determine which group investigates ( with it ) what however , with the new ' alert ' it will provide us better data than we had before and it will keep the unmapped positions out of the west portfolio . the only time the west would be affected by this change in the future is if a new power gas book is set up for your traders . i hope i have addressed your concerns . if i have not , please give me a call or e - mail me back . thanks , stacey ( 3 - 1870 ) to : stacey w white / hou / ect @ ect cc : subject : re : potential gas system exposure does any of this impact the west anymore ? who is going to be "" alerted when positions are loaded to the ' dummy ' account .

Date: Not suppliedGreat Village Voice story about oddball museums in New York. My favorite 
weird-ass museum is the Museo de Criminologia in San Jose, Costa Rica, which 
has bits of victims of famous crimes (machete-dented brain-pans, severed arms, 
etc) floating in formaldehyde jars.     A stone's throw away is the singular Freakatorium, El Museo Loco, a classy 
    treasure chest of curiosities belonging to sword swallower Johnny Fox, 
    whose focus is the rich history of America's earliest museums, from P.T. 
    Barnum's American Museum to the Bowery Dime Museums. The walrus penis bone 
    (other penis bones on display: coyote, mink, fox, raccoon) is enough to 
    make you feel you're getting your $5 worth. But then you spy the Jivaro

"Hi All,Anyone ever try connecting at 1200bps in Linux? I've got a USR 56K
Faxmodem which is meant to connect to another (same) modem and I have to
connect at this speed due to the (NT) port settings on the remote side,
but the modem handshake always fails at this speed.The modem handshake works at slightly higher speeds (4800bps to
~57600bps) but that is no good for tx/rx'ing data to the remote server
as it insists at talking at the speed of treacle/1200bps.Note Minicom fails to handshake at 1200bps, but HyperTerm in Windows
worked first time(!?), any ideas?Baud 1200 7 data bits Even ParityI am doing a ATZ3 to reset the modem then I send this init string:AT&F1E1V1Q0X4Y0S32=232&A1&B0&C1&D2&H0&I0&K1&M4&N0&P0&R1&S0&U0&Y1... which is most of the defaults.USR said to set S15=128 (disables v.42)) 
& set S32=98 (disable v.92 & X2)But the S15=128 just makes the handshake lockup instead of just giving
up.btw this is a bank's system I am connecting to so reconfiguring their
modems may be difficult.Colin.

"a few questions for you hi louise hope all is well and that your trip to and from london went smoothly ! a few questions : 1 . does enron have a system which collects data by customer ? we have something called cmis which we use for these purposes and which i believe we will need to integrate into the infrastructure if you don ' t have something already . we usually need customer info for reg reporting purposes . 2 . bob dinerstein believes it would be prudent to have a seminar of sorts whereat the heads of gas and power trading present to key ubsw people what their businesses are all about , example trade flows , competitive pressures , key reg reporting requirements , etc . he would also anticipate having our outside counsel participate to discuss what they understand to be the developing regulations in these markets . the thought is to try and do this on thursday because so many ubsw people will be on the ground in houston for the simulation exercise . i don ' t know that i am wedded to that day and i am a bit unsure about whether this makes sense given it may interfere with progress on integration but this day may work since alot of people will already be there and i am sure the traders will not be interested in doing anything like this once they start trading . what do you think ? the audience would include key logistics personnel from ubsw and enron and anyone else you thought appropriate . spoke with mike about it and he is fine . 3 . having ubsw paraphenalia sent down - toys , shirts , etc . , should be arriving by no later than tuesday . if you haven ' t received anything by late on monday could you let me know so i can track down . ubsw and ubsw energy banners are being made to hang from the ceiling on both trading floors - they should arrive by wed . 4 . was thinking perhaps we should have a celebration on the floor on friday to commemorate the closing . what do you think ? 5 . i am planning to be down in houston for most of next week . i thought it would be helpful to be on site in order to be available to address issues as they arise in order to meet closing on friday . i will be leaving on a late monday flight and returning on a late afternoon friday flight . i hope you think this will be useful . please let me know otherwise . sorry for the long message . please feel free to call me at home or on my cell if you have any questions , issues , would like to discuss h 914 764 4597 c 917 523 6132 . colette visit our website at http : / / www . ubswarburg . com this message contains confidential information and is intended only for the individual named . if you are not the named addressee you should not disseminate , distribute or copy this e - mail . please notify the sender immediately by e - mail if you have received this e - mail by mistake and delete this e - mail from your system . e - mail transmission cannot be guaranteed to be secure or error - free as information could be intercepted , corrupted , lost , destroyed , arrive late or incomplete , or contain viruses . the sender therefore does not accept liability for any errors or omissions in the contents of this message which arise as a result of e - mail transmission . if verification is required please request a hard - copy version . this message is provided for informational purposes and should not be construed as a solicitation or offer to buy or sell any securities or related financial instruments .",Safe Email

company finds a replacement.Jain, a former Microsoft executive, founded InfoSpace six years ago and led 
the company through its rise and fall. His departure from the top posts was 
announced Wednesday.With its stock now trading for dimes, InfoSpace is in danger of being 
delisted from the Nasdaq Stock Market. The company is asking shareholders 
to approve a one-for-10 reverse stock split to prop up the price. If 
approved on Sept. 12, shareholders would trade in 10 shares of stock for 
one new share.The company has had trouble retaining its top-level executives in the past, 
including most recently, former chief executive Arun Sarin who resigned 
last year after just nine months on the job.The company said Jain will remain as a company employee.Shares of InfoSpace fell 2 cents to 43 cents in afternoon trading on Nasdaq.http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork

"complexity in language contact , acquisition and change newsletter 1 . workshop on complexity in language contact , acquisition and change . 8 september 1998 , paris , france . in colaboration with the cnrs ( centre national de recherche scientifique ) , the lot ( netherlands graduate school of linguistics ) is organizing some workshops to create a forum to encourage the discussion between researchers in linguistics from the netherlands and france . one of the workshops is initiated by members of the university of amsterdam and has as its subject : complexity in language contact , acquisition and change . the workshop will take place on tuesday the 8th of september , starting at 14 . 30 until approximately 20 . 00h . the theme although there is a kind of dogma that all natural languages are equally complex , at least for certain subsystems of language there may well be differences in complexity . in discussions of processes of language change and first and second language acquisition the notion of complexity plays an important role . especially in creole studies simplicity and complexity implicitly have been dominant issues in the debate , but are seldom properly scrutinized . in this workshop we want to discuss the role of complexity in these domains , including grammatical theory , first and second language acquisition , language change and language contact - in order to shed light on controversial problems invoked by the term complexity in linguistics in general . the structure of the workshop the workshop is organized around three themes : creole languages , language acquisition and language change . each theme will be discussed by researchers from france and the netherlands in 10 minutes presentations , inspired by the following propositions . after these short presentations there will be time for discussion in each session . 1 . all languages have the same "" costs / payment "" balance , i . e . if a language becomes phonologically more simple , its morphological system will become more complex . [ cf . haugen 1976 : 286 ] 2 . all complexity in languages resides in the lexicon . [ cf . aronoff 1995 ] 3 . languages spoken within small communities are more complex than languages of large communities . [ cf . whinnom 1980 , hymes 1971 , mhlhusler 1996 ] 4 . language shift will in general lead to simplification , while borrowing will lead generally to more complex structures . [ cf . thomason & kaufman 1988 ] 5 . complexity does not play a role in first language acquisition , but it does in second language acquisition . [ cf . trudgill 1992 ] 6 . grammaticalization leads to greater complexity .

                               time for a snooze         There comes a time in every August when news services should
         just shut the hell up, because the weather's too hot or too
         underwater, and the world grows so dull and hazy that even
         the overexcitable hardcore at LinuxWorld wander around like
         it's Undead Expo 2002, and the Weiss-baked Macintoxins can
         barely lift their wallets for MacOS X.2, and Sun can't be
         bothered to do anything but run s/RedHat/Sun Linux/g on a
         free distribution disk, and everyone else is on holiday, or
         getting ready to be on holiday, or being told that perhaps
         they should take a holiday RIGHT NOW, and all we can do is
         look at this awful, awful EUCD legislation and stare out the
         window until dawn.         Yeah, it's our annual no news edition. We moved to a faster
         server. Do take the rest of the weekend off in celebration.         Or, alternatively, build up a head of overexcitement for
         the public appearance of THOMAS DOLBY - the ""Hyperactive""
         chart artist and Beatnik audio plug-in advocate who, even as
         you read this, appears to be hosting a 350 Euro-per-head
         seminar on COMPOSING POLYPHONIC RING TONES at Helsinki's
         Radisson Royal Hotel in Finland. Lucky delegates will learn
         about ""using real-time MIDI controllers for tweaked
         effects"", ""techniques for making little speakers sound huge""
         and - perhaps most distressingly - ""picking the right
         instrument and register for best audibility"". The
         cacophonous cavalcade comes to London's Soho House on Tue
         and Wed next week if you'd like to check it out for
         yourself - or perhaps hold a street protest on behalf of
         music lovers worldwide.

         sloppy little unrigorous languages he never let into the

         SMALLTALK, that dirty treat-me-like-an-object ducky. Version
         2.0b sprouts HTML-embedding and experimental MySQL support -
         implying you might actually be able to do something useful
         with it. Admittedly, ""useful"" has not been a word  much used
         in the Smalltalk community recently. Many of the current

         planet Earth. Talk of cleaning up the object tree are rife;
         coders are working on XP-alike skins (instead of Squeak's

"On The Way to Telluride, On My Way Back to the World8/29/02Dear friends,I go to turn my computer on but I have forgotten where the on/off switch
is. I have had this laptop for three years, but I haven't turned it on for
the past two months. I look on its left side, I feel around the back, I
find it on the right and I feel like an idiot. The screen reads ""fatal
error"" and offers to ""save"" whatever I had typed on it last June 21st, a
few weeks before my mother died. I hit CTL.ALT.DEL. and it is gone. Gone.
Gone like this long, sad, summer, frozen now, and nothing seemingly matters
but everything matters more now than ever before. Why did she have to die?
When will this pain stop? I got up this morning to fly out to Colorado. The Telluride Film Festival
is screening my film tomorrow night, the first time it will be shown in the
United States. My mother did not get to see this new film. She was always
so proud of everything I did, cheering me on every day from the day where
my memory begins. I had shown an early cut of the film to my friends last
winter in my parent's living room, and mom would come in and out of the
room, catching a scene here and there, saying, ""Boy, that's something,
isn't it!"" I don't feel right, right now. I have avoided most people for the past two
months. I can't conceive in my mind having to face a crowd of strangers, no
matter how supportive or appreciative they may be. Everyone says to me it
will be good to get back to work, good to be busy, take my mind off my
sadness, as if not aware that what I really might need is for it to be the
other way around. At my family's insistence, I tried going on TV a few
weeks ago to talk about the corporate crooks roaming our great land. I had
decided to give it a try, and gave it my best shot, and ended up feeling so
empty and more alone. I had agreed to go on ""Crossfire"" and Donahue (thank
God for this guy!) on the condition that I would not have to have one of
those stupid cable news shouting matches with three rightwingnuts where no
one can hear (or wants to hear) what's being said. They agreed to the terms, but as Bob Novak asked his first question about
aren't my true motives to destroy capitalism and make America a socialist
country, I just sat there for a moment and didn't respond. I thought I
would just take the microphone off and leave - who needs these f-----s! -
but then, my dad was with me in the studio and I looked over at him and
smiled, and then into the camera I said, yes, Bob, that is exactly what I
intend to do and, considering more people have bought my book than any
other nonfiction book in America this year, I guess that means that the
majority of Americans agree with me on this point, so look out Bob 'cause
we're going to seize your money first! I asked the studio audience in DC
for a show of hands of all those who agreed and I was later told that
numerous hands shot up in the air, much to the chagrin of a stunned Bob
Novak. I also added that I thought the Pope was onto something when he said
that capitalism is a ""sin.""My dad liked that. He is a sweet, strong, smart man and I loved the drive
with him back home. We took a spin through the Michigan State campus and he
told me how he had come down here after World War II to inquire about going
to college but thought it best to return to the assembly line where he had
a secure job. His years during the war serving in the Marines were going to
be counted toward his seniority. And so he worked the spark plug and oil
filter assembly line for 33 years and provided for mom and us kids and gave
us all his love -- which, of course, mattered the most.                       *        *       *       *       *        *Dad took me to the airport this morning, remarking on the way how much mom
would have enjoyed this simple trip across town to Bishop Airport, how
happy she would have been knowing that I was heading off on a new journey
in my very fortunate life. I thought about how she came to New York for the
screening of ""Roger & Me"" at the New York Film Festival in 1989, and how I
got to introduce her and my aunt as they sat in the front of the balcony,
and how mom and Aunt Lois stood and took a long Lincoln Center bow, and how
I stood on that stage and felt that she deserved every bit of that applause
and more. It's a bittersweet memory now, as I've just found out that the NYFF
selection committee this year is too afraid to show my new film.
""Politics,"" is what I have been told. Too ""populist"" for the new elite who
now sit in judgment of what is art. ""They don't want to help further your
platform Mike,"" a person close to the committee tells me. ""One of them even
said, 'I know this film is going to be popular - and I don't personally
want to contribute to its popularity.'""  So, it was decided that ""Bowling
for Columbine,"" a Cannes prize-winner, knighted by the Chicago Tribune as
""one of the most effective political/polemical films ever,"" a film chosen
by every single film festival around the world this fall - no, this film
must not be shown at Lincoln Center just six blocks from the edit room
where we made it... 77 blocks north of ground zero. I've gone too far this
time, cut too close to the bone, stuck my lens where it doesn't belong -
right straight through the heart of an America that is both master and
victim of the ultra-violence. It is so sad to see this place where I will
always remember my mother taking that bow now cowering to the whims of neos
who, like their counterparts in Hollywood, preside over the demolition of a
once great art form.                     *      *      *      *      *      *      *My dad drops me off and goes to park in the short-term lot. He comes inside
just as the airport personnel are taking everything out of my suitcase for
inspection. They don't ask to see the print of the film, the only thing I
might have had on me that is poised to do any real damage (to all the right
people, of course). My dad and I stop short of the metal detectors and the
next round of inspectors who are anxious to look at my smelly feet. We hug,
and he kisses me, and I am trying hard, so very hard, to not break down in
the middle of this airport. He tells me not to worry about him, and I tell
him I'll call him from Detroit when I am changing planes. I go through
security and as I am being taken aside to be searched again, I look back
and see him still standing there, watching out for me. My dad.I'm on the plane and I'm thirsty, but I took the water bottle out of my bag
when I packed it this morning. The bottle, half-drank, had been sitting
untouched in my untouched bag since I stuck it in there the night we had to
rush my mom to the hospital. The bottle was still there in that overnight
bag where I put my t-shirt and sweatpants, the ones I had on for the night
and day I sat by my mother's side in the hospital as she struggled to live,
holding her hand, holding her head, trying to comfort her, strands of hair
on my sweater. I can see the stains from where my tears and mucus ran
uncontrollably down my face and onto that sweater. The doctor said she had
an 80% chance of making it. An hour before she died, another doctor said
the chances were 1 in 100. That was good enough for me. One in one hundred!
I've had those odds! I won! Don't let her die! Please do everything you can
do! Don't let her die.The priest came, then another priest came, and when the priests left my dad
asked us three kids and the three grandkids to all join hands and say our
goodbyes to mom, say whatever we wanted to about what she meant to us. (I
am sorry... I cannot complete this paragraph right now, I can't see the
screen through the tears...maybe someday...)The night before we rushed her to the hospital I had a little surprise
planned for her. I had brought a copy of my new movie and I was going to
show it to her. As the end credits would roll, she would get to see what
she has seen at the end of all of my work: her name along with my dad's in
that list of credits...and, to me, it's the only real credit that ever
mattered -- because without them I would not have the life they gave me,
the way they raised me... it is all a privilege I will never cease being
thankful for.I never got to show her the movie that night. ""Mike!"" she called out from
the porch, in a pitch of voice I had never heard. ""Get your father! I don't
feel good."" She was, without warning, dying. Within 48 hours she would be
gone.                 *          *          *          *          *          *I'm walking through the Detroit airport to gate 75 for the flight to
Denver, and I hear someone say, ""OK, Mr. Stuckup, just walk right on by!"" I
turn to see it is one of anchors from the local TV station in Flint. I
apologize. My sunglasses are on. I have been crying since I left my dad at
the Flint airport. I explain this to her and she starts to get tears in her
eyes. ""My mom died in October,"" she says, and I realize that this pain that
feels so solitary is, truthfully, a shared experience amongst us all. No
one is immune from this loss. But instead of taking the time to tell me
about how rough it has been for HER, she asks about how I am doing and how
is my dad doing and did we get the flowers she and the others sent. She
gives me her number and says to call anytime if I feel the need to talk. At
that moment I remember what she told me -- that her mother also died this
year-- and I think, man, get over yourself, Mike, you are not alone in
this, and so I ask her how she is doing. ""I think a lot,"" she says, ""about
all the things she won't see my two children grow up to do, to be. But I
believe she is in my heart, right here, right now, and she will see it
all.""They call my flight and I rush over to the payphone to call my dad to see
if he got home OK. He tells me that when he left the short- term lot he got
talking to the person in the tollbooth who told him about her mother
getting cancer and how she was caring for her. ""She said that her bill in
the hospital came to $60,000,"" he says with astonishment. ""They won't be
able to pay it. She makes six dollars an hour, no health insurance. I gave
her a tip along with the toll.""""You gave the tollbooth worker a tip?""""Well, you have to. That person could be you or me.""That is my father. That was my mother. Yours, Michael Moore

http://www.techcentralstation.com/1051/printer.jsp?CID=1051-072302BJust Ask the Experts
By Sallie Baliunas and Willie Soon 07/23/2002
In 2001 the National Science Foundation surveyed 1,500 people nationwide
and found that 77% believed that ""increased carbon dioxide and other gases
released into the atmosphere will, if unchecked, lead to global warming
..."" Yet half of those polled believed that humans and dinosaurs co-existed
on Earth, despite the scientific fact that the dinosaurs went extinct tens
of millions of years before the earliest hominids appeared. Worse, only 22%
of the respondents understood what a molecule - for example, carbon dioxide
- is.As in the case of the belief by many that dinosaurs and early humans
co-existed, public opinion does not change the actual facts about the
material world. Such a poll measures nothing more than the degree of public
ignorance about scientific matters.Most people get news stories about science and technology developments from
television. And after more than a decade of being fed what-if stories about
global warming from human activities, no wonder most people ""believe"" that
global warming ""will"" occur. However, on the anxiety scale, only 33% ""worry
a great deal"" about global warming, a worry that ranks at 12 out of 13
environmental concerns. The top environmental fear, shared by 64% of those
polled, was polluted drinking water.So What Do We Know?Concerning the latest understanding on human-made global warming, here are
three points we know from the science:   1. The surface record of temperature from thermometers show widespread
warming in the 20th century compared to the 19th. There was one period of
warming early in the 20th century, the second after the 1970s. Ecosystems
have responded to this widespread warmth, not seen since ca. 800 - 1200 C.E.      But the cause of global surface warming cannot be associated with
human activity without additional information. Some media reports point to
ecosystem responses of 20th century warmth (e.g., mountain glacier retreat)
and unjustifiably claim the responses owe to man-made causes. But mountain
glaciers receded during the past period of warmth around 1,000 years ago,
and advanced during the unusual cold of the Little Ice Age (ca. 1300 - 1900
C.E.). Both those climate shifts occurred naturally, before the increased
concentration of human-made greenhouse gases in the air.
    # All computer simulations of climate say that in order to conclude
that the surface global warming trend is human caused, the surface warmth
must be accompanied by an equal or larger warming trend in the air from one
to five miles in height. Measurements made by satellites and verified from
weather balloons show no meaningful human-made warming trend over the last
two or even four decades. Thus, the recent warming trend in the surface
temperature record cannot be caused by the increase of human-made
greenhouse gases in the air.
    # The computer simulations are not reliable as tools for explaining
past climate or making projections for future trends.Future Shock: The ScenariosWhen it comes to future scenarios, consider what the experts actually say
about potential climate change. The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel
on Climate Change writes in its Special Report on Emissions Scenarios
(2000), ""Scenarios are images of the future or alternative futures. They
are neither predictions nor forecasts."" Further, ""The possibility that any
single emissions path will occur as described in the scenario is highly
uncertain,"" and finally, ""No judgement is offered in this Report as to the
preference for any of the scenarios and they are not assigned probabilities
of occurrence, neither must they be interpreted as policy recommendations.""Forecasting future societal conditions and energy use often amount to
little more than unconvincing guesses. Jesse Ausebel at Rockefeller
University in April 2002 critiqued the U.N. IPCC's "" ... 40 energy
scenarios, with decarbonization, or carbonization, sloping every which way
and no probabilities attached. ... It is a confession that collectively
they know nothing, that no science underlies their craft, and that politics
strongly bias their projections.""Nonetheless, such a guess about the world's energy future forms the first
step in making a 100-year prediction of global warming. That first
uncertain forecast - future energy use - used as input in the climate
simulation surely compounds the uncertainty in the next step, the climate
forecast.Inability to predict the future should not be surprising. The climate
simulations upon which predictions are based yield unreliable results
because, as outlined above, the results are incompatible with measurements
of how the climate has changed in the last few decades.Complete SpeculationOn May 24, 1994, Richard Lindzen, the Alfred P. Sloan Professor of
Meteorology at MIT, testified to the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural
Resources, ""The claims about catastrophic consequences of significant
global warming, should it occur at all, are almost completely speculative.
Not only are they without any theoretical foundations, but they frequently
involved assuming the opposite of what appears to happen.""Despite years of solid work by climate specialists, the output of computer
simulations remains undependable, owing to the extraordinary complexity of
the natural world. Thus, on May 1, 2001 Lindzen testified to the Senate
Commerce Committee about the long-standing inability of computer
simulations to deliver results that resemble reality, even in the cases
where good measurements are available:""For example, there is widespread agreement [among climate scientists] ...
that large computer climate models are unable to even simulate major
features of past climate such as the 100 thousand year cycles of ice ages
that have dominated climate for the past 700 thousand years, and the very
warm climates of the Miocene [23 to 5 million years ago], Eocene [57 to 35
million years ago], and Cretaceous [146 to 65 million years ago]. Neither
do they do well at accounting for shorter period and less dramatic
phenomena like El Ninos, quasi-biennial oscillations, or intraseasonal
oscillations - all of which are well documented in the data, and important
contributors to natural variability.""
Lindzen explained the failure of computer simulations simply in May 2000:""The point I am making is that it is a fallacious assumption that the
models have everything in them, and will display it, and somehow the rest
is just technical uncertainty. There are things they literally don't have.""
This punctuates the popular notion that averaging output from computer
results will somehow, miraculously, give a scientifically appropriate
result.Think LocallyNow, on top of the unreliable forecasts of global warming -- which rest on
""highly uncertain"" forecasts of future economic and social conditions and
un-validated climate simulations -- come the forecasts of local impacts, in
order to make the case for relevancy to people. Increased storminess is one
prediction of the outcome of human-made global warming found in the popular
media, which would be where most people learn about the issue.The idea that storminess increases with human-made global warming defies
expert opinion. David Legates, an expert hydrology researcher, testified in
the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works on March 13, 2002:""Ascertaining anthropogenic changes to these extreme weather events is
nearly impossible. Climate models cannot even begin to simulate storm-scale
systems, let alone model the full range of year-to-year variability...
Clearly, claims that anthropogenic global warming will lead to more
occurrences of droughts, floods, and storms are wildly exaggerated.""
The U.N. IPCC Third Assessment Report concurs, ""[T]here is currently
insufficient information to assess recent trends, and climate models
currently lack the spatial detail required to make confident projections.
For example, very small-scale phenomena, such as thunderstorms, tornadoes,
hail and lightning, are not simulated in climate models (Summary for
Policymakers, p. 15).""A group of extremely relevant experts, the American Association of State
Climatologists, recently summarized the state of climate simulations:""Climate prediction is complex with many uncertainties ... For time scales
of a decade or more, understanding the empirical accuracy of such
predictions - called ""verification"" - is simply impossible, since we have
to wait a decade or longer to assess the accuracy of the forecasts. ...
climate predictions have not demonstrated skill in projecting future
variability and changes in such important climate conditions as growing
season, drought, flood-producing rainfall, heat waves, tropical cyclones
and winter storms. These are the type of events that have a more
significant impact on society than annual average global temperature
trends.""
On the facts of human-made global warming, should one believe television or
the experts?--

"sum . : history of capitalisation in english back in late january / early february i posted a query to linguist about sources on the history of capitalisation in english . several people responded asking me to post a summary to the list on any replies i might receive . my apologies for the delay , but i have been fighting three different winter "" bugs "" ( some viral , some bacterial ) since my original posting , and then had to rush to catch up on acadaemic commitments before the end of term ! anyway , here is the summary . . . . the most immediate "" success "" reply , so to speak , came from david denison at u . of manchester , u . k . : mrcepdd @ fsl . art . man . ac . uk . david suggested the following article : osselton , noel ( 1985 ) ' spelling - book rules and the capitalization of nouns in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries ' . in arn , mary - jo and hanneke wirtjes ( eds . ) . * * historical and editorial studies in medieval and modern english : for johan gerritsen . * * wolters - noordhoff , groningen , pp . 49-61 . to my delight , i found that "" my "" university library ( knight lib . at the u . of oregon ) had precisely this volume . the article ( chapter ) is only 6 pages long , but contains as well a list of spelling books and grammars , etc . to which osselton referred in the text . there is also a page of notes . this reference is the most useful i have yet seen , and i will be using it ( when i have the time ) as a foundation for finding more info . on this topic . a good place to start , i think . a reply from john e . koontz ( koontz @ bldr . nist . gov ) pointed me towards usenet lists which , i regret , i have not yet been able to try . john suggests comp . fonts , or hte repositories of past usenet postings ( he is not sure where they are ) , or the usenet faq collections . also , comp . text . larry rosenwald ( lrosenwald @ wellesley . edu ) suggested looking into the literature of printing history , as he reminded me that "" in fact capitalization was often regularized by the printer .

"re : business offer dear sir , greetings , i am mr . henry okoye the account manager of mr . ziya bazhayev in standard trust bank regional office in victoria island , here in lagos . however i got your contact through the international web directory . i decided to contact you by email because i feel that it is more secured and private . recently we discovered a dormant account with a huge amount of money valued usd 35 , 000 , 000 . 00 ( thirty five million dollars only ) that belongs to one of our late customer who died in a plane crash . during our investigation and auditing in this bank , my department came across a very huge sum of money belonging to mr . ziya bazhayev , president of the oil alliance company who died on yak - 40 aircraft , on a charter flight from moscow to kiev on march 9 , 2000 . the fund has been dormant in his account with this bank without any claim of the funds in our custody either from his family or relation before our discovery of this development . the banking law here stipulates that if such money remains unclaimed for six years , it will be forfeited to the bank treasury as an unclaimed bill . it is only a foreigner that can stand as a next of kin and it is upon this discovery that i decided to contact you to collaborate with you to pull out this dormant fund . in order to avert this negative development , i on behalf of my trusted colleagues now seek your permission to have you stand in as next of kin to our late customer so that the fund will be released and paid into your account as the beneficiary ? s next of kin now that the bank is still expecting a next of kin or relative of the deceased , mr . ziya bazhayev . you will read more news about the plane crash on these websites , http : / / www . amarillonet . com / stories / 031500 / usn _ lao 703 . 001 . shtml and http : / / news . 1 chinastar . com / ll / english / 61934 . shtml in fact we could have done this deal alone but because of our position in this country as civil servants , we are not allowed to operate a foreign account and that would eventually raise an eye brow on our side during the time of transfer since we still work in this bank , this is the actual reason why we required a second party or fellow who will assist us forward claims as the next of kin and also provide either an existing bank account or to set up a new bank a / c immediately to receive this fund , even an empty a / c can also serve for this purpose . on smooth conclusion of this transaction , you will be entitled to 40 % as gratification for your assisting us , and the remaining 60 % will be for me and my partners . what i want from you is for you to act as the deceased next of kin . i have in my possession , all the necessary documents to successfully accomplish the operation . bear in mind that this proposal is 100 % risk free . further information will be given to you as soon as i receive your positive response . i suggest you get back to me as soon as possible stating your wish . find in the attachment of my family picture , to proof who i am . i await your urgent responce . regrads , mr . henry okoye",Phishing Email

Here is what you do.Remove all the PCI & ISA/EISA cards. Remove the floppy disk cable from the mobo, the ide cables from the mobo... essentially leaving only a video card... ram and a keyboard plugged in.Turn on the system. If it doesn't POST then, switch it off and remove the video card.Switch it back on ... if your mobo doesn't emit some beeps complaining about lack of video card then.Switch it off. Remove it's ram.Same procedure as above.If you still don't have any kind of mobo beep codes then you can try as a last ditch effort to reseat the cpu... (remembering to never ever ever power up your system without a heatsink & fan).If after reseating the cpu into the mobo... you still get no beep codes, from it with just the cpu inserted into the mobo ie(no pci,*isa cards or and no actual ide or floppy cables connected to the system)... even though you have power... you either have a faulty motherboard or a faulty cpu.Once you get beep codes various permutations of the above should eventually disjunct which device it is, is causing the lack of POST.

"update on lodi and wheeler ridge storage projects western undeterred by grueling regulatory process expressing frustration but continuing its resolve , texas - based western hub properties is ironing out some "" technical issues "" of financing with california regulators and now expects to start construction in february on its delayed lodi gas storage field in northern california . the merchant storage project will be operating by this time next year , said western hub ' s california - based manager , jim fossum , who added that with faster approvals , the project could have been in service during this summer ' s electricity generating crunch and the current gas and power shortages . despite the regulatory struggle , he said the company still plans to go through with its other california storage project near bakersfield and the natural gas hub called wheeler ridge . western has acquired leases on the property it needs and will start more detailed engineering of the proposed site over the first three to six months of next year . the company intends to make a filing with state regulators in summer of 2001 . in both the approved lodi project ( see daily gpi , may 19 ) and the proposed wheeler ridge storage field , western is not concerned about lining up customers , said fossum . the projects are not contingent on contracts , he said . "" now that we are a bona fide ( certified plant ) utility under the california public utilities commission , we are getting some technical things worked out with the commission staff and nailing down the last small pieces of property , fossum said . "" everything is basically ready to go at lodi "" "" we have to file with them documents that verify certain aspects of the project ' s financing . we can ' t move ahead with the financing until the cpuc approves it . "" if we had not encountered all of the roadblocks that we have had , we could have helped with the problems this last summer , and we could be helping with problems right now . "" he added that the project would not be operational in time to have any impact on the upcoming summer electricity demand and corresponding heavy natural gas demand to fuel power plants . lodi and the wheeler ridge storage project are being designed as high - deliverability storage facilities . lodi will have about 9 bcf of working capacity , building to 12 bcf . initially , fossum said , lodi should have about 400 mmcf / d injection capability and 500 mmcf / d withdrawal . in the southern half of the state , western for some time has been doing reservoir studies near wheeler ridge and now has a "" couple of reservoirs that we think might work , "" fossum said . "" we ' re in the preliminary planning phase . "" the wheeler ridge project would have an ultimate working capacity of 12 to 16 bcf and similar 500 mmcf / d deliverability at its peak . he said western hopes to have something operational in the wheeler ridge area by the end of 2002 .",Safe Email

Hi, 
   I am wondering if there are any techniques to make a CD-Key of the like 
unbreakable.  Either by giving it a cancelation date and a periodic renewal 
from a server or just by using self md5 signature on the resulting 
executable.  I know it must not be easy because the whole software piracy 
problem would be resolved but there must be some way to make it really hard 
to break it.  Anyone have hints on this issue ?Thanks- --

"**Dublin**: something from the archives. Daev Walsh forwards an article from The Irish Digest about ''Billy in the Bowl''. This story is also immortalised in an old Dublin song, which in turn was mentioned in a Pogues track. Billy was a legless beggar in the alleys of Stoneybatter and Grangegorman (where I now live) during the 18th century, who discovered a new, but not entirely legal, way to make money.BlogEnd: LinkText: Billy in the BowlFrom: daev Subject: The Case of the Stoneybatter StranglerA story of my new neighbourhood... The Irish Digest July 1964 The Case of the Stoneybatter StranglerThe handsome, deformed Billy in the Bowl evolved a plan to rob his donors. Then, one night, he made the biggest mistake of his life DUBLIN in the eighteenth century was noted for two things - the architectural beauty of its public buildings and the large number of beggars who sought alms in its maze of streets and lanes. Many of these beggars relied on visitors and the gentry for their coin, but there was one who campaigned among the working class. This was ""Billy In The Bowl""The strange appellation was derived from the fact that Billy's sole means of transport was a large bowl-shaped car with wheels. Seated in this "" bowl "", the beggar would propel himself along by pushing against the ground with wooden plugs, one in each hand.Billy's unusual means of conveyance was vitally necessary, as he had been born without legs. Nature, however, had compensated for this by endowing him with powerful arms and shoulders and, what was most important, an unusually handsome face.This was Billy's greatest asset in his daily routine of separating sympathetic passers-by from their small change.The cunning young beggar would wait at a convenient spot on one of the many lonely roads or lanes which were a feature of eighteenth century Grangegorman and Stoneybatter, until a servant girl or an old lady would come along.He would then put on is most attractive smile which, together with his black curly hair, never failed to halt the females. The fact that such a handsome young man was so terribly handicapped physically always evoked pity.""Billy in the Bowl"", however, wasn't satisfied with becoming the daily owner of a generous number of small coins; what his greed demanded were substantial sums of money. The more he managed to get the more he could indulge in his pet vices - gambling and drinking.As a result the beggar evolved a plan to rob unsuspecting sympathisers. The first time lie put his plan into operation was on a cold March evening as dusk, was falling. The victim was a middle aged woman who was passing through Grangegorman Lane on her way to visit friends in Queen Street - on Dublin's North Quays.When Billy heard the woman's footsteps, he hid behind some bushes in a ditch which skirted the lane. As his unsuspecting victim drew close, the beggar moaned and shouted, and cried out for help.Trembling with excitement, the woman dashed to the spot where Billy lay concealed. She bent down to help the beggar out of the ditch, when two powerful arms closed around her throat and pulled her into the bushes.In a few minutes it was all over. The woman lay in a dead faint, and Billy was travelling at a fast rate down the lane in his "" bowl "", his victirn's purse snug in his coat pocket. An hour after the robbery the woman was found in a distracted condition, but failed to give a description of her assailant. And, as ""Billy in the Bowl"" had figured, nobody would suspect a deformed beggar.Again and again the beggar carried out his robbery plan, always shifting the place of attack to a different part of Grangegorman or Stoneybatter.On one occasion "" Billy in ""the Bowl "" tried his tactics on a sturdy servant girl who put up such a vigorous resistance that he was forced to strangle her. The incident became known as the 11 Grangegorman Lane Murder and caused a great stir.Hundred.s flocked to the scene of the crime and for a couple of months ""Billy in the Bowl"" was forced to desert his usual haunts. Around this period, Dublin's first-ever police force was been mobilised, and the first case they were confronted with was the Grangegorman lane murder.Months passed and ""Billy in the Bowl"" reverted once again to his old pasttime. A number of young servant girls were lured into ditches and robbed, and the police were inundated with so many complaints that a nightly patrol was placed on the district. But the beggar still rolled along in his ""bowl"" pitied and unsuspected. Then came the night that finished Billy's career of crime.Two stoudy built female cooks, trudging back to their places of employment after a night out in the city, were surprised and not a little shocked to hear shouts for help. Rushing over, they came upon a huddled figure in the ditch.Billy, thinking there was only one woman, grabbed one of the cooks and tried to pull her into the ditch. She proved much too strong for him, however) and while resisting tore 'at his face with her sharp finger-nails.Meanwhile, her companion acted with speed and daring. Pulling out her large hatpin she made .for the beggar, and plunged the pin into his right eye.The screams and howls of the wounded beggar reverberated throughout the district and brought people dashing to the scene. Among them was a member of the nightly police patrol who promptly arrested the groaning Billy.""Billy in the Bowl"" was tried and sentenced for robbery with violence, but they could never prove it was he who had strangled the servant girl. The Grangegorman-Stoneybatter district became once again a quiet, attractive Dublin suburb where old ladies strolled, and carefree servant girls laughed and giggled as they wended their way home at night.daev_______________________________ Rev.

Here is what our customers are saying about the Temple â€œ3â€ Ragga Dagga (TM) phenomenon:â€œTo whom it may concern,I was skeptical when I first read your ad.  I grew up in the 70â€™s & 80â€™s.  I was a hard core (alternative smoker) then.  So I knew my stuff.  But drug tests stopped that!  Now I am disabled from a degenerative muscle, ligament, and tendon disease.  I was smoking (an illegal product) for the pain and nausea.  Now I have something just as good; Temple 3, but cheaper, and it is legal!  I also have a lot of trouble sleeping, but the Capillaris Herba made into tea works and smells great!  Your products that I tried so far, are as good or better than your ads say!  That is hard to find nowadays in a company.  Who ever put this stuff together is a botanical genius.  I will be a customer for life!  Also, I talked with a lady on the phone when I was ordering, and asked her to find out if I could get my products and samples to hand out for free.  And just send the customers to you.  Or get a discount on products that I could sell retail to people.  I would prefer the earlier one becau!
se!
, I can just talk about your products, I am a great salesman (about 10 years experience), I could hand out flyers, give out little 1 gram pieces as samplers with your business card enclosed, etc.. I am going to be unable to work a regular job for a while, maybe indefinitely?  This deal would give me my own products and samples for free?  You would get free advertising, word of mouth, samples into peoples hands to try, someone that is very good with computers, someone who studied about mail order, Internet, cold calling, small business, good with people, etc..  I would like to be doing something, even if I would get on Social Security Disability.  It is very disheartening not being able to work to support my 2 teenage boys, or do a lot of the things I used to do!  At least I would be able to do something worthwhile.  And great products makes it real easy to sell.  Let me know what you think?Sincerely,RJâ€Location: Midwest, U.S.A.â€œThank you so much for the Ragga.  It is everything you guys claim, and then some!  I was a bit skeptical when I read your description of its effects, but there is literally no exaggeration in your advertisements.  How nice that this is non-prohibited!  It tastes great and feels great too!  I am so glad I took a chance and ordered.  Blessings to all of you.â€-- Frankie R.Location: West Coast, USAâ€œIâ€™m a man of my 40â€™s and I really know my stuff.  I donâ€™t drink or do illegal drugs anymore and have found a much more spiritual path.  I used to have to take Valium in the past.  Not anymore with the Temple â€œ3â€.  It really amazes me how this stuff tastes like the Lebanese and blonde stuff I used to smoke in the 70â€™s.  I am very satisfied with all of your products.  I like them a lot and will be a customer for life for sure.  Whoever makes this stuff is an ARTIST at it.  Who would have thought?!â€  -- A.J.Location: United Kingdom

"they were plenty upset about the tea taxes.But the crack down on colonial script certainly screwed over the American Colonies. And, BTW, England as well.Dear Ben Franklin was right for the wrong reasons. First of all the colonies were not prosperous compared to England proper. Second, the issuance of colonial script had nothing to do with full employeement.(In fact, it is almost inconceivable he would make that claim. It sounds like a modern Keynsian was creating an urban legend.)OTOH the lack of sufficient circulating monetary instruments was economically crippling. Imagine trying to buy your supplies by offering IOUs on your own name -- and then trying to market / exchange the paper as the merchant who took the IOU.===========================The most common problem in the world is when a government prints too much money. The effects are a complete disaster. There are a lot of incentives that push governments into doing this even though it is incredibly stupid.So almost all the literature talks about that.But you can ALSO screw an economy over by taking all the money out of circulation. The fundamental cause of the American Great Depression was exactly this, courtesy of the Federal Reserve Board.I don't think shifting the power to print money to the bank of Canada had much effect.

"6 . 351 language policy frank ashen focussed on the divisive effects of promoting one of several indigenous languages to the position of official language and used the much quoted justification that speakers of not-chosen languages may feel disadvantaged . he did not mention the effect of the introduction of a foreign world language on the vernaculars . the introduction of foreign official language has , in africa , led to explicit negative attitudes amongst the speakers themselves towards their languages . the alternative to the selection of an indigenous language as official language seems to be to disadvantage the whole population . in most african countries the foreign official language generally has a very low penetration so that only the elite know it . knowledge of the official language then becomes a new factor that determines access to power and the well-paid jobs . at the same time the vernaculars are ignored or stigmatised . this means that no or very little funds are available for their development and teaching . this means , to come back to tove skutnabb - kangas ' comments , that the population cannot exercise their "" right to learn their mother tongue , both orally and in writing , up to a high level . "" the assumption that frank ashen quotes is based on a false departure point , namely that only a colonial language can save an african country from being torn up by its own internal divisions . i do n't recall any wars based on language differences prior to colonisation . africa solved its linguistic diversity by developing lingua francas . djit ? recently ( 1993 ) showed that the use of so-called international languages such as english and french have not solved the communication problems of the african masses but in many cases contributed towards the "" pathology of linguistic bakwardness "" . the fact that these languages ( such as wolof , swahili , hausa , lingala ) are actually spreading - without much official help - seems to indicate "" a general willingness for cooperation and a cultural and linguistic tolerance that ignores the political boundaries inherited from colonization "" djit ? ( 1993 : 162 ) . spencer ( 1985 : 395 ) claims that the introduction of european languages to africa retarded the spread of what he calls "" african vehicular languages "" . however , adegbija ( 1994 : 26-27 ) is sceptical of the ability of african lingua francas of being accepted outside their present geographical domains . he also warns against the imposition of these languages . it would seem that we need a three-language policy such as that of india : one language for communication with the outside world known by a relatively small section of the population ; one lingua franca for national and regional communication and the various vernaculars for local business and primary education . in many african countries this is the de facto situation and trilingualism is more common in africa than outside linguists seem to realise . this suggestion might avoid the subtractive language learning ( that characterises many african communities ) and that tove skutnabb - kangas finds "" a violation of minorities ' linguistic rights "" . the sources that i referred to : adegbija , e . 1994 language attitudes in africa : a sociolinguistic overview . clevedon : multilingual matters . djit ? , p . g . 1993 "" language development in africa .

ZDNet AnchorDesk NewsletterTUESDAY, JULY 16, 2002
Why we're changing our publishing schedule
Dear Reader,As of Monday, July 15, AnchorDesk is being published on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, instead of five days a week. The AnchorDesk Weekly newsletter will continued to be published every FridayWhy are we doing this? There are several reasons, but the most important one is giving me a chance do more than just sit behind a desk typing all day in order to meet deadlines.  I've been writing five columns a week for 18 months now, and I'd be lying to you if I didn't admit to being more than a little tired.  Also, I've been on such a short leash that I haven't been able to travel or meet as many people as I'd like. This new schedule means I'll have more time to get out, learn more, see more products, and discover new issues or trends. So it should result in a more interesting and useful AnchorDesk for you.Having additional time also means I will be able to work on several projects I've been assigned, including one that could bear fruit at the Consumer Electronics Show next January. More about that soon, once all the details are nailed down.For now, the new schedule is being called a ""test,"" which means it could turn out to be temporary--or maybe not. We'll run it through the end of the summer and see how it works. I appreciate your continued support of AnchorDesk. While the column will be less frequent, I will still be on CNET Radio every weekday at noon PT (or on-demand streaming anytime) and hope you will join me there.Sincerely,
David Coursey
Executive Editor

I'm gonna fix this one. I think the best solution will be to copy the modified 
rules to blib and install them from there. Then the rules files will be 
changed on build time and not install time, too. ------- You are receiving this mail because: -------

"cognitive linguistics theme session call for papers 6th international cognitive linguistics association ( icla ) conference ( stockholm , july 1999 ) typological research on signed languages : cognition and discourse structure session coordinators : sherman wilcox and terry janzen several hundred signed languages are known to exist in the world , used within communities in which the signed language is the primary language . most grammatical description of these languages , however , is not extensive , and is confined to no more than a handful of these languages . there is speculation that signed languages may share a significant number of linguistic features even when such languages are genetically unrelated , due in part to their common use of the hands and body as articulators and the eyes , rather than ears , as perceptual organs . very little actual work , however , has been carried out with respect to which specific grammatical features are shared , and which may differ . many questions surrounding the relationship between cognition and signed language structure involve the cross-linguistic typology of structural and semantic categories . it is not yet clear , however , whether certain linguistic features of signed languages emerge cross-linguistically because users of these languages employ similar articulatory and perceptual systems , and how much variation between and within particular categories exists . the purpose of this session is to focus on information processing and discourse structure as typological features among signed languages . a cognitive approach to this topic assumes that signers will structure their discourse to best represent and convey what is cognitively salient , and that the grammar that emerges within a community of language users will reflect this cognitive motivation . we invite papers which focus on cognition and features of discourse structure in a variety of signed languages , with the intention of facilitating discussion among researchers regarding typological features . abstracts ( 700 to 1400 words ) are invited , and should be submitted by november 31 to each of the following : wilcox @ unm . edu tjanzen @ post . rrcc . mb . ca = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = sherman wilcox , ph . d . associate professor dept . of linguistics university of new mexico albuquerque , nm 87131 http : / / www . unm . edu / ~ wilcox",Safe Email

"OK, let's bring some data into the discussion:

be causal.> With respect to absolute CO2 concentrations, it is also important to

 show that the current CO2
concentrations are at 370ppm, 18% *greater* than the *highest* recorded
value from the past 400k years. Furthermore, CO2 concentrations are growing
at 15ppm every 10 years, much faster than any recorded increase in the
Vostok data (though perhaps the Vostok data isn't capable of such fine
resolution).> In other words, we may be adding to the CO2 levels,No, we are *definitely* adding to CO2 levels. Look at the following chart:
http://www.grida.no/climate/vital/07.htm
(Shows CO2 concentrations since 1870, the ""historical record"").Not only is the CO2 increase over 130 years unprecedented in the Vostok
record, it is clear that the rate of change is *increasing*, not decreasing.
There is no other compelling explanation for this increase, except for
anthropogenic input. You're really out on the fringe if you're debating
this -- even global warming skeptics generally concede this point.> but it looks a lot like we
> would be building a molehill on top of a mountain in the historical

> concentrations.Wrong again. Current CO2 levels are currently unprecedented over the past
400k years, unless there is some mechanism that allows CO2 levels to quickly
spike, and then return back to ""normal"" background levels (and hence the
spike might not show up in the ice cores).Still, by around 2075-2100 we will have reached 500 ppm CO2, a level that
even you would have a hard time arguing away.> Also, CO2 levels interact with the biosphere in a manner that ultimately

finite capacity to store CO2, and if the world temperature doesn't increase,
but we all have Seattle-like weather all the time, the effects would be
enormous.> Last, as greenhouse gases go, CO2 isn't particularly potent, although it

> biosphere.Correct.Data on relative contributions of greenhouse gasses:
http://www.grida.no/climate/vital/05.htmNote that methane concentrations now are *much* higher than pre-industrial
levels (many cows farting, and rice paddies outgassing), and methane is also
a contributor in the formation of atmospheric water vapor. Another clearly
anthropogenic increase in a greenhouse gas. I'm in favor of reductions in
methane levels as well.Data on water vapor here:
http://www.agu.org/sci_soc/mockler.html> CO2 was an easy mark for early environmentalism, but all the recent

reducing global warming. I favor an energy policy that has a mix of solar,
wind and nuclear, with all carbon-based combustion using renewable sources
of C-H bonds. Aggressive pursuit of carbon sink strategies also makes sense
(burying trees deep underground, for example). Approaches that involve
reductions in lifestyle to a ""sustainable"" level are unrealistic --
Americans just won't do it (you'd be surprised at the number of climate
change researchers driving SUVs). But, as California showed during last
year's energy crisis, shifts in patterns of consumption are possible, and
improved efficiency is an easy sell.- Jim

"" mistakes "" which the author made ( statements which would render the text less valuable for comparative philosophy ) are tacitly "" corrected "" ( read : deleted ) , terminology is adjusted etc . - this phenomenon itself is grounded in the personal union of translator and historician , translator and interpreter , translator and commentator . while a translation of a novel can be done by one person , who is a translator in a more technical sense , and can be thoroughly researched in its historical impact by somebody else , who is a literature-historian , this is not only uncommon in the field of comparative philosophy ( or the study of other cultures ' philosophies ) , but also hardly feasible - for in most cases , even the philological constitution of the texts in question has to be informed by the interpretation . this results in a quite difficult ( and peculiar ) position of translation in the whole hermeneutical process - in most cases , the translation will serve as a "" second-language "" - commentary to the translated texts , not presenting an otherwise inaccessible philosophical text in its own right to those who do not understand the source-language , but a ) justifying the constitution of the text , b ) clarifying the interpretation on part of the translator and c ) ( see above ) justifying the project of translation for those who not only do understand the source-language , but who are already basically familiar with the historical and philosophical environment . in this context , translation loses much of its "" mediating "" function between two languages , but becomes a tool of explanation , which , in some contexts , can even be dismissed with ( i have seen and heard many specialists in indian philosophy whose explanations are basically made up of sanskrit terms , only vaguely connected by english copula ) . while this can naturally be explained on account of different target audiences ( translations for specialists will be different from translations for non-specialists ) , i find that this different function of translation is not recognized within the "" specialists ' "" group at all . in other words : criteria which would apply to judging a translation in a broader context ( e . g . a translation of a novel ) are applied to translations which are carried out in this specific context , without even considering a possible difference in the pragmatic environment . i would thoroughly appreciate any opinions on this , birgit kellner institute for indian philosophy university of hiroshima",Safe Email

"review : scobbie : autosegmental representation scobbie , james m . ( 1997 ) autosegmental representation in a declarative constraint - based framework , garland press , new york . [ revision of 1991 phd dissertation , university of edinburgh ] [ * ] michael hammond university of arizona jim scobbie 's dissertation , recently published in the outstanding dissertations in linguistics series through garland press , is an excellent example of a pre - optimality - theory attempt at a constraint-based phonology that has received insufficient attention in the phonological community . this is extremely unfortunate , as the thesis makes a number of interesting proposals that are well worth considering today . the dissertation is not in the usual vein of american phonology theses . it 's not an in-depth analysis of some particular array of data . rather , it appears to fit a much more european template , with more attention paid to placing the author 's proposal in the context of previous ideas . despite this very different approach , there is much to recommend it . the general hypothesis pursued is that phonological generalizations and representations are best cast as attribute-value structures . these formal devices are drawn from the hpsg ( head - driven phrase - structure grammar ) literature ( pollard & sag , 1987 ) . the basic idea is that dominance is expressed as something roughly equivalent to a featural distinction . for example , in a standard phonological representation the fact that a vowel might be high is expressed by assigning the vowel a ' + ' for a feature [ high ] , e . g . [ + high ] . expressed in attribute-value formalism , the attribute [ high ] has the value ' + ' . hpsg goes one step further and encodes dominance in the same fashion . thus , the fact that a syllable has a [ + high ] nucleus is expressed by positing a nucleus attribute for a syllable element and then allowing the nucleus attribute to itself have [ + high ] as an attribute-value pair . ( 1 ) the formal object above denotes a syllable with a [ + high ] nucleus . ( i ' ve indicated irrelevant information with ellipses . ) in the context of these representations , scobbie 's central claim is that autosegmental association can be formalized as dominance in an attribute-value structure . phonological representations also encode linear order , but in scobbie 's theory , linear order is formalized only for root nodes ( and is indicated with indices ) . a string of segments would then be represented as a set of indexed root matrices , essentially of the following sort . ( 2 ) indices are ordered by the relation immediate precedence ' ' . [ 1 ] with these structures , scobbie goes further and suggests that phonological rules should be traded in for constraints . these constraints , he suggests , are formally indistinct from the representations they apply to . ( a rather similar position has been advanced in ot . see russell , 1995 and hammond , to appear . ) for example , a generalization excluding mid nasal vowels would be expressed as follows . ( 3 ) such an expression rules out an element which is simultaneously specified [ - low ] , [ - high ] , and [ + nasal ] . constraints do n't actually "" apply "" to representations . rather , scobbie proposes , constraints are unified with representations . unification allows to representations to meld , just so long as they do n't conflict . for example , a representation consisting solely of ifferent elements . for example , the index variables below indicate that the two matrices share the token value for a , but merely share the type value for b . ( 6 ) scobbie develops this formalism in a number of ways . first , he argues that representations like the one above are subject to what he calls the sharing constraint ( p . 93 ) . ( 7 ) sharing constraint if a structure is dominated by two paths of type p with indices i and j , where , then for every index n where there is a path dominating m . the immediate effect of this is to rule out cases where noncontiguous root elements share a token value . scobbie argues that the evidence for such cases is weak . ( cf . a very similar proposal in archangeli & pulleyblank , 1994 . ) a more interesting consequence is that scobbie uses this constraint in an attempt to derive the no - crossing constraint ( ncc ) , part of goldsmith 's ( 1976 ) more general well - formedness condition on autosegmental representations . this is the constraint that rules out crossing autosegmental association lines . sagey ( 1986 ; 1988 ) first proposes to derive the ncc from a treatment of autosegmental association as overlap . however , hammond ( 1988 ) argues that this notion is formally problematic proposing a different characterization of association as a transitive , irreflexive , and asymmetric relation . hammond 's approach , however , does not derive the ncc without stipulation . scobbie 's approach also involves an asymmetric characterization of association ( as dominance ) , but does derive the ncc . scobbie 's derivation of the ncc is based on the assumption that there are no contour values . that is , while two different root nodes might share a value token as in the second picture below , one root node cannot bear two different values , as in the first picture below ( where "" s "" indicates a segment or root node and "" t "" indicates a tone or value token ) . ( 8 ) this is a necessary position given his formalization of sequencing : only root nodes bear an index for linear position ; nonroot tokens are unsequenced . ( a similar position is developed in heiberg , in prep . ) were contour values to be allowed , there would be no way to distinguish their ordering . on the other hand , when two root nodes share a value , their ordering is distinguished in terms of indices , as in ( 6 ) . the upshot of the prohibition on contours is that violations of the ncc can only arise when there is an independent sharing violation . that is , ncc violations look like ( 9 ) , and ( 9 ) necessarily includes a sharing violation . ( 9 ) this is a very nice result , but comes at the cost of i ) ruling out discontinuous association , and ii ) excluding contour values . scobbie also argues that his approach allows him to derive the phenomenon of geminate integrity ( hayes , 1986 ; schein & steriade , 1986 ) . the basic idea of geminate integrity is that geminates resist epenthesis . ( see guerssel , 1977 ; 1978 for an early treatment and suh , 1997 for a recent proposal . ) the standard account of this is that geminates resist epenthesis because the result would entail crossing association lines , and a violation of the ncc , as in ( 9 ) above . the problem with this , as noted by scobbie and others as well , is that if the epenthetic vowel is featureless ( 10 ) or inserted on another tier ( 11 ) , then no violation of the ncc occurs . ( 10 ) ( 11 ) scobbie 's own proposal is simple and direct . epenthesis into a geminate structure results in a violation of sharing , regardless whether the epenthetic vowel has features or whether its features might appear on some other tier . scobbie goes on to consider the possibility that geminate inalterability might also follow from the sharing constraint , but here his proposal is a lot more speculative . the basic idea pursued is that geminate inalterability results from default rules . the problem is that scobbie does n't really offer a clear proposal on the nature of default rules . on the face of it , they would seem to be a glaring problem for the monotonic theory he proposes . in his final substantive chapter , scobbie treats the problem of long-distance association , as in , e . g . arabic verbal morphology . he offers some well-taken criticisms of the traditional autosegmental approach , but does not really offer an explicit declarative counterproposal . in sum , this book is well worth reading . it offers a very interesting alternative constraint-based view of phonology with much to recommend it . on the other hand , there are a number of unresolved questions . what about floating segments ? scobbie speculates on this , but offers no satisfying solution . as noted above , contour segments are also ruled out , though the evidence for these in the tonal domain is unimpeachable .

' ' citigroup , the largest u . s . financial services company , is probably owed $ 1 billion at most , analysts say , and much of that is backed by collateral such as gas pipelines , on which it should be able to collect . the company ' s profit may be lowered by between $ 250 million and $ 500 million before taxes , or between 3 cents and 5 cents a share after taxes , as a result of its involvement with enron , said napoli , who recommends investors buy citigroup shares . citigroup earned $ 2 . 08 a share in the first nine months of the year . hurting earnings j . p . morgan chase - - which enron says is owed $ 2 . 1 billion - - says its exposure totals about $ 900 million - - $ 500 million unsecured , and $ 400 million backed by collateral . that exposure could result in a 15 - cent decline in earnings per share , said goldman , sachs & co . analyst richard strauss . the second - largest u . s . bank earned $ 1 . 54 a share so far this year . j . p . morgan chase acts as a representative for holders of enron bonds , so while the company is listed by enron as a creditor on $ 1 . 9 billion of bonds , it may not be owed a cent on that debt . enron ' s $ 2 . 45 billion debt to bank of new york may work in much the same way , said lehman brothers analyst henry dickson . he estimated the bank is owed about $ 50 million . much of j . p . morgan ' s exposure is tied to citigroup ' s $ 3 billion loan to enron , a credit enron doesn ' t even mention . a syndicate of at least five other banks - - including j . p . morgan chase - - contributed to that loan , according to bloomberg data . as lead arranger , citigroup likely holds about 10 percent of the loan , meaning its exposure is about $ 300 million . j . p . morgan chase ' s share of that is likely less . bank of america corp . , commerzbank ag and barclays bank plc are among other enron lenders not listed as creditors . still , concern that the banks ' losses may exceed forecasts helped send their shares and bonds lower today . citigroup shares fell 99 cents to $ 46 . 91 in trading on the new york stock exchange . citigroup ' s 7 . 25 percent notes due in 2010 fell to 107 28 / 32 from 108 21 / 32 , pushing the yield up 21 basis points to 6 . 18 percent from 5 . 97 percent . j . p . morgan ' s stock lost $ 1 . 17 to $ 36 . 55 . its 7 . 9 percent coupon notes due in 2010 fell $ 16 per $ 1 , 000 face amount to 111 3 / 32 , pushing the yield up 23 basis points to 6 . 18 percent from 5 . 95 percent on friday . bank of new york ' s 7 . 3 percent notes maturing in 2009 fell about $ 20 per $ 1 , 000 face value to 108 3 / 32 from 110 7 / 32 , traders said . yield on the debt rose 32 basis points to 6 . 01 percent from 5 . 69 percent . its shares dropped $ 1 . 04 to $ 38 . 20 . ` ` they ' re big numbers , but these are big institutions , ' ' said greg habeeb , a bond money manager at calvert group , which doesn ' t own the banks ' securities . ` ` i wouldn ' t be going running out buying the bonds now , but i don ' t think ( enron losses are ) big enough to worry about .

"" the events in israel have created a lot of uncertainty , "" said peter coolidge , senior equity trader at brean murray & co . "" that more than counteracts any positive news on the economic front . "" at least 25 people were killed over the weekend in attacks by palestinian suicide bombers in jerusalem and the northern israeli port city of haifa . on monday , israel fired nine missiles near palestinian leader yasser arafat ' s headquarters in gaza city in an apparent retaliation . the violence overseas detracted from some fairly upbeat readings on the u . s . economy , including a report from the commerce department that consumer spending rose by a record 2 . 9 % in october . robust spending on cars and other big - ticket items contributed to the reading ' s largest jump since 1959 , when the data series began . the previous record had been a 2 . 6 % increase in september 1987 . personal income was virtually unchanged for the second month in a row , roughly in line with economists ' forecasts . the commerce department also surprised economists by reporting a 1 . 9 % increase in total construction spending for october . forecasts had that figure falling by 0 . 5 % . september construction spending was revised to show a 0 . 7 % drop from the 0 . 4 % decline previously reported . meanwhile , a closely watched index of manufacturing activity rose more than expected in november . the national association of purchasing management reported monday that its purchasing managers index rose to 44 . 5 last month from 39 . 8 in october . economists have been forecasting the pmi would rise to 42 . a pmi reading of 42 . 7 is considered the threshold between expansion and contraction in the wider economy . so november ' s pmi of 44 . 5 suggests that the economy is growing , albeit slowly . last week , the national bureau of economic research formally declared that the country had entered a recession back in march , ending the longest period of economic expansion in u . s . history . the government reported that total economic activity fell at an annual rate of 1 . 1 % in the july - september quarter . against this backdrop , analysts called the latest napm data encouraging . "" after absorbing last month ' s aftershock of the terrorist attacks , the manufacturing sector showed surprising resilience in november , "" norbert ore , director of the survey , said in a statement . "" the trend is definitely in the right direction , but it is too soon to claim an imminent recovery . based on this report , the sector regained a significant portion of the output lost in october , "" mr . ore said . matthew freedman , an economist at economy . com , said the napm report "" shows that the deterioration in manufacturing appears to be slowing quite dramatically . "" but the stronger - than - expected numbers did little to comfort investors , who have been scrutinizing economic readings in recent weeks for signs that the business cycle has hit bottom . the markets are especially interested to see if rising levels of unemployment will put a dent in consumer spending , which is considered a key to keeping the current economic recession a mild one . most major international markets traded lower monday , but the u . s . economic data helped narrow the losses late in the day in europe . frankfurt ' s xetra dax closed essentially flat and london ' s financial times stock exchange 100 - share finished 0 . 8 % lower . in asia , tokyo ' s nikkei 225 stock average closed with a loss of 3 . 1 % , and hong kong ' s hang seng index dropped 1 . 1 % . meanwhile , the turmoil surrounding energy - trading giant enron continued over the weekend , as the company filed for bankruptcy protection on sunday . the houston firm simultaneously sued its would - be merger partner dynegy for "" not less than $ 10 billion , "" accusing it of wrongful termination of their merger pact . news of the impending collapse of enron had weighed heavily on the market last week . some market participants suggested enron ' s bankruptcy filing - - the largest in u . s . history - - continued to pull stocks lower on monday . but others said it was largely expected and was having little effect on share prices . "" it could hurt the markets somewhere down the road , but i haven ' t heard a lot of people talking about it [ monday ] , "" said mr . coolidge of brean murray . enron shares rose 11 cents to 37 cents . dynegy was down nearly 8 % . financial - services stocks took a hit monday , dragged lower by some negative comments from analysts and fears about exposure to the enron debacle . shares of brokerage firm morgan stanley sank 6 % after goldman sachs analyst richard strauss pulled it from his recommended list and cut his rating on the stock to "" market perform "" from "" market outperform .

"re : 5 . 1404 comparative method in linguistics karl teeter is mistaken , i think , when he says that you cannot classify languages on the basis of phonological correspondences in the lexical items , when he says that you would treat english and french as related ( via the norman borrowings ) if you did this , when he says that the idea of using this method is "" novel "" , when he says that you can only classify lamnguages as related if you have written a comparative grammar , etc . ( a ) for many language families , there is no other basis for classification available , because they lack the kind of morphological complexity so beloved of indo - europeanists , algonkianists , and those other - ists who happen to enjoy its blessings in "" their "" languages , ( b ) the danger of confusing borrowings for cognates is always real , but it is easy to see that the lexical connaections of english with french are more transparent phonologically and less central semantically than those with dutch , hence more recent , hence borrowings .

I'm not sure they are doing strictly help-desk stuff.
But the whole 'who in their right mind would use that? it doesn't have all

strength in this approach (agents and/or IM as ui) than can find a nich

Kind of like a web query - and with google, someone else can turn them into

What about a situation where you don't directly ask/talk to the bot, but
they listen in and advise/correct/interject/etc?
example: two people discussing trips, etc. may trigger a weather bot to
mention what the forecast says - without directly being asked.

( ene ) , an ice press release said tuesday , without mentioning enron by name . investors have been watching to see if enron ' s trading partners in its core business - north american gas and power marketing - significantly reduce activities with the financially troubled top energy marketer . ice is considered a primary alternative to enron ' s internet - based commodities market , enrononline . ice ' s volume of north american bulk power trades last week totaled a record 54 million megawatt - hours , a 34 % increase over the october weekly average . north american natural gas volumes rose 13 % from october to 950 billion cubic feet last week . oil trading rose 45 % to a record 55 million barrels , and metals trading volumes was up 66 % . "" we believe that this has resulted , in part , from the uncertainty that has been exhibited in several key energy trading venues over the pas several months , "" said ice chief executive , jeffry sprecher . enrononline is different from ice because enrononline is a mechanism for companies to buy from , and sell to , enron . ice is a neutral multiparty exchange , allowing energy trading companies to trade with all other members . ice ' s trading system , which has been installed in 7 , 000 desktops worldwide , covers 600 commodity and derivative contract types . ice also owns the international petroleum exchange of london , europe ' s largest energy futures exchange . ice is owned by companies including american electric power ( aep ) , aquila energy ( ila ) , bp amoco plc ( bp ) , deutshe bank ag ( g . dbk ) , el paso corp .

' s ( pge ) securities as follows : senior secured debt to ' bbb + ' from ' a ' ; senior unsecured debt to ' bbb ' from ' a - ' ; preferred stock to ' bbb - ' from ' bbb + ' . the rating watch status has been revised to evolving from negative for all intermediate - to long - term securities . a rating watch evolving means the ratings may be raised , lowered or maintained . pge ' s commercial paper has been downgraded to ' f 2 ' from ' fl ' , with a stable outlook . the downgrades for pge reflect substantial ongoing uncertainty at its parent , enron ( ene ) . ene ' s senior unsecured debt is rated ' bbb - ' , with a rating watch evolving . ene ' s financial flexibility has been severely impaired as a result of recent developments primarily surrounding its investment in structured transactions . on oct . 16 , 2001 , ene announced a $ 1 billion after tax charge to third quarter 2001 earnings and a $ 1 . 2 billion reduction to balance sheet equity relating to the unwinding of structured transactions . in addition , the company has restated its financial results for the 1997 - 2000 period , incorporating off - balance sheet entries related to the structured transactions and is the subject of a securities and exchange commission ( sec ) investigation focusing on the company ' s accounting for the partnerships . these events badly eroded investor confidence in the company , effectively blocking its ability to access capital markets , and forcing management to seek a corporate suitor . on nov . 9 , 2001 , dynegy ( dyn ) announced that it reached a definitive agreement to acquire ene in a stock - for - stock transaction under which ene shareholders will receive a fixed amount of dyn shares . the proposed dyn transaction will provide significant financial support to ene , and should enable ene to fund its cash needs through the first quarter of 2002 under expected business conditions , despite ene ' s significant refinancing risk . the merger requires regulatory approvals , including hart - scott - rodino , the sec , and the federal regulatory energy commission ; assuming regulators approve the merger , we would expect the transaction to close in six - to nine - months . the merger agreement includes termination provisions that add an element of uncertainty to its completion . fitch anticipates that the surviving company ' s rating would move to the mid - ' bbb ' range assuming the successful execution of its interim plans to delever its capital structure and the completion of the merger . if the merger were terminated fitch believes ene ' s ability to manage its business would be severely impaired and would expect to downgrade its securities to highly speculative levels . pge ' s new ratings also recognize its strong standalone credit profile , the prospective regulatory ring - fencing required by oregon regulators , and the pending sale of pge to northwestern natural gas ( nwn ) , in addition to its interim status as a subsidiary of ene . the evolving status for pge recognizes that its ratings could drop if the ene / dyn merger were terminated , or improve , if ene ' s credit rating is upgraded in the future . pge ' s credit quality ratios and financial strength are expected to temporarily weaken in 2001 , reflecting the absence of cash recovery of unusually high wholesale power costs . in august 2001 , the oregon public utility commission ( opuc ) authorized higher pge rates , effective october 1 , 2001 , to recover such costs . importantly , the commission order adopted a power cost adjustment mechanism that will allow the company to pass through the lion ' s share of its power procurement costs to customers on a timely basis in the future . the cash recovery of power procurement costs allowed in the opuc order , combined with declining wholesale power procurement costs over the balance of this year should alleviate financial pressure at pge and facilitate improving credit measures in 2002 . the pge ratings consider fitch ' s assessment of nwn ' s acquisition funding plan and the anticipated post - merger holding company structure . nwn recently announced an agreement to acquire pge from ene in a transaction valued at $ 2 . 9 billion , including the assumption of $ 1 . 1 billion of pge debt . the transaction is expected to close by the end of 2002 and requires several regulatory approvals , including the sec , the opuc , and the washington utilities and transportation commission . as part of the transaction , nwn expects to form a new holding company ( holdco ) , which will raise the new debt and equity required to complete the purchase of pge . post - merger , pge and nwn will operate as wholly owned first tier subsidiaries of holdco . as currently contemplated , the approximate $ 1 . 8 billion cash portion will be funded at holdco with approximately 78 % debt and 22 % common equity and hybrid convertible preferred stock . as a result , holdco ' s consolidated and individual credit measures are expected to be relatively weak , as consolidated debt to capitalization could reach 75 % at closing . pge ' s ultimate post - merger ratings will depend on several factors , including , the ability to gain operating synergies from its affiliation with nwn , the credit ratings fitch assigns to holdco , and the structural protections provided pge investors by state utility regulators . the current regulatory ring - fencing applied by the opuc requires pge to maintain a 48 % common equity ratio , thereby limiting the amount of cash pge can dividend up to its parent company . it is expected that similar ring - fencing from the opuc will continue under the new holdco structure . contact : fitch , new york philip smyth , 1 -

' ' frances laserson , moody ' s vice president of corporate communications , declined to comment . ` ` our discussions with clients are highly confidential , ' ' she said . critical role moody ' s played a critical role in part because enron was already having trouble raising money . the company had had its rating lowered in october and a slowdown in the economy had prompted some banks to restrict credit . a downgrade to junk by moody ' s , which rates more than $ 85 trillion in securities , would have created a cash crisis by forcing enron to repay early $ 3 . 3 billion of bonds and limiting its ability to sell short - term debt . a junk rating would have prompted dynegy to abandon the acquisition , said watson , and cost lehman , j . p . morgan chase & co . and salomon smith barney inc . a collective $ 105 million in fees for advising the two companies . in seeking to salvage the rating , the executives argued a downgrade to junk would lead enron to file for bankruptcy protection . they said moody ' s would shoulder the blame , according to people involved in the conversations . on thursday morning , moody ' s was willing to take that risk . executives at the ratings company , led by chief administration officer debra perry , told watson and his bankers at lehman that it was about to issue a press release cutting enron to junk . moody ' s officials said enron couldn ' t keep an investment grade rating because the company had no access to the commercial paper market . a probe by the securities and exchange commission into its accounting practices and a 90 percent plunge in its shares had eroded investor confidence . calling on friends with little time to respond , watson and senior wall street bankers swung into action . watson called his friend david o ' reilly , chief executive officer of chevrontexaco inc . , dynegy ' s largest shareholder . o ' reilly didn ' t have time at such short notice to push enron ' s case , watson said . next he enlisted john watson , chevrontexaco ' s chief financial officer , and darald callahan , a member of the boards of dynegy and chevrontexaco , to call moody ' s . lehman ' s ceo fuld and chief fixed - income analyst ted izatt also pitched in , as did j . p . morgan ceo harrison and michael carpenter , who runs salomon , a citigroup inc . unit . izatt , the no . 1 ranked analyst for investment grade energy companies according to institutional investor magazine , previously worked as a managing director at moody ' s . j . p . morgan chase and salomon were advising enron . officials at lehman , j . p . morgan chase and salomon declined to comment through spokespeople . fees watson said he and other bankers argued a combined dynegy and enron would be a much stronger company given a $ 1 . 5 billion cash injection from chevrontexaco , which owns 26 percent of dynegy . ` ` to be honest , i didn ' t understand why moody ' s was having difficulties making this happen , ' ' watson said . later that day , moody ' s executives told dynegy they were prepared to keep enron at investment grade as long as six changes were made to the proposed acquisition , according to watson . most of the changes focused around the ` ` material adverse change ' ' clause , which allowed dynegy to cancel the deal under certain conditions . one of those changes would have required dynegy to eliminate a clause that allowed the company to walk away if enron ' s debt ratings were cut to junk . watson said he agreed to the changes . ` ` if things got bad enough at enron that it had to be taken to junk , there would probably be a material change in its business that would allow us to walk away , ' ' he said . chevrontexaco watson and kenneth lay , enron ' s ceo , signed off on the revised terms on thursday . chevrontexaco , however , had yet to agree . o ' reilly first heard of the changes from lehman bankers at a dinner on thursday night celebrating chevron corp . ' s $ 45 . 8 billion acquisition of texaco inc . , that was being held at the victor stewart steakhouse in walnut creek , san francisco , according to people at the dinner . lehman ' s bankers , including steve wolitzer , co - head of mergers and acquisitions , and two colleagues , carlos fierro and grant porter , flew to san francisco that day to participate because they had advised chevron on the deal . during the flight they received emails on their blackberry pagers from colleagues in houston detailing the concessions that moody ' s had sought . tuna steaks after discussing the new terms with o ' reilly over tuna steaks and filet mignon , the group agreed to reconvene at chevron ' s offices in san ramon , california at 6 : 45 a . m . local time friday morning . while the officials were deliberating , moody ' s cut its rating on enron to ` ` baa 3 , ' ' one level above junk . john diaz , a managing director who follows the company for moody ' s , said at the time that enron now needs to ` ` shore up confidence in the company so that counter - parties continue to trade with it .

"" enron ' s core business is strong , and that was a key reason dynegy undertook merger discussions with enron , "" stengel remarks . both stocks rose sharply monday , enron adding 61 cents to $ 9 . 24 and dynegy rising $ 5 . 55 , or 14 % , to $ 44 . 31 . still , enron remains 22 % below dynegy ' s implied acquisition price . the stock action suggests the market is deeply divided over the deal . the deep discount on enron is a sign that the deal won ' t get done . yet dynegy ' s leap implies solid investor backing for the transaction and its economics . until we know more about enron ' s numbers , we won ' t be able to judge whether dynegy investors are right to be bullish , however . strong indeed among the deal ' s avid supporters were a number of sell - side analysts who are longtime enron bulls . they particularly liked dynegy ' s prediction that the combined entity , to be called dynegy , would post earnings 35 % above current 2002 estimates for stand - alone dynegy . and these bulls point out that this accretion number doesn ' t include any merger synergies and it assumes enron ' s 2002 earnings are $ 1 . 50 , which is 25 % lower than analysts currently expect . dynegy executives repeatedly stated monday that they wanted to get rid of enron ' s noncore operations and keep the trading business , which has contributed the lion ' s share of enron earnings , as well as pipeline assets . clearly , dynegy believes that enron ' s core trading business made real profits . how much of a leap of faith is that ? a considerable one . as this column has noted , enron doesn ' t make it possible to break out profit margins for trading , which is included in the wholesale line in enron ' s income statements . in fact , the wholesale line includes substantial asset gains , many of which are probably one - time in nature . enron ' s deals with obscure partnerships gave a huge boost to profits , according to earnings restatements made last week . don ' t forget that it ' s these partnership dealings that are under investigation by the securities and exchange commission . without them , and excluding one - time sales , enron ' s traders may actually make very little . marky mark one fear was that dynegy would have to mark down enron ' s underperforming assets by billions of dollars . charges erode equity . lower equity would possibly mean a higher debt - to - capital ratio ( calculated by taking debt as a percentage of total capital , or debt plus equity ) . if this ratio gets above 50 % to 55 % , rating agencies might consider downgrading dynegy , which could deter counterparties from trading with it . but dynegy expects the debt - to - capital ratio to be about 40 % in the merged institution . somewhat implausibly , dynegy ' s forecasts don ' t appear to factor in big markdowns in enron equity . in the third quarter of next year , enron ' s equity is expected to be $ 9 . 5 billion . that ' s only slightly below what it probably was at the end of this year ' s third quarter ( enron still hasn ' t released a third - quarter balance sheet ) . how can it not decrease over the next 12 months ? a person familiar with the matter says that dynegy also expects to mark up enron assets at the time of the deal ' s closing . these markups are expected to at least partially offset any markdowns , this person adds . but it ' s tough to identify any enron assets that could qualify for hefty positive adjustments , while it ' s easier to point out assets that deserve negative ones . dynegy needs to break out markups and markdowns and reveal which assets are being subject to the adjustments . dynegy ' s stengel didn ' t comment on the question of equity writedowns . by stretching too far in its assumptions , dynegy may be trying to dress up a risky merger as a safe one . but a risky merger may , in dynegy ' s view , have been preferable to having enron go down . again and again monday , dynegy execs said they ' ve done their due diligence and they believe that there aren ' t any huge skeletons in enron ' s closet that could upset the merger . but contrast this stance with that of standard & poor ' s analysts , who said friday that they would ' ve downgraded enron ' s debt to junk status if dynegy hadn ' t agreed to buy enron . one of the s & p analysts said friday that they didn ' t have a full understanding of all the partnerships that enron has been dealing with . if s & p , which , like other rating agencies , has been locked in deep and detailed discussions with enron for weeks , doesn ' t know the effect of all the partnerships , how can dynegy ? "" dynegy has been doing business with enron for 16 years . we know them and they know us , "" stengel replies . "" we are comfortable with the due diligence we have conducted thus far and will continue to look at enron and their operations in the coming weeks and months .

"" now , even if dynegy ' s $ 9 billion takeover of enron fails , the power generator can keep the energy trader ' s northern natural gas pipeline , according to the merger agreement .

"" in a subsequent e - mail , stengel said "" we are going to comply fully with ferc regulations . "" the answer was in response to a question about how dynegy plans to guard against abuse once it owns a pipeline system . in the executive summary dynegy filed to the ferc , the company claimed that structural affiliate preference "" is a far greater threat to market participants in coming years . "" dynegy contended that a pipeline or transmission company affiliate "" can always pay more , or withstand greater risk from , services purchased from home pipelines because of the benefits inuring to the parent holding company . "" dynegy also alleged that because affiliates control the pipelines , they crowd out competitors . one concern dynegy listed is the "" vertical overlapping "" of gas pipeline companies and utilities . dynegy owns the electric and gas utility illinois power . in its comments , dynegy advocated structural changes to the affiliate relationship in order to prevent abuse of the system and eliminate the preference problem . dynegy also recommended that if "" rampant "" abuse is found , the company should be required to divest the non - regulated affiliate .

I occasionally buy X-10 stuff.  I've learned from past experiences to 
create a quick mail alias to get order confs and what not.  Then can 
it once the order is complete because those spamming SOBs will not 
stop filling my inbox with 3-6 ads per day.  I've LARTed them and 
their upstream numerous times asking to be list washed.  I don't even 
get an auto-ack.  I started a procmail recipe to reject mail to them 
and include a form letter (I was planning on later appending every 
piece of x-10 spam I've archived to the form letter for their reading 
pleasure...) but I haven't gotten it to work.  Bottom line, if I gave 
them permission to mail me (explicitly or via privacy policy), it's 
not spam but once I told them to stop mailing me then it's spam.My $.02

"1999 genetic and evolutionary computation invitation to become a member of the program committee for the 1999 genetic and evolutionary computation conference ( gecco-99 ) http : / / www-illigal . ge . uiuc . edu / gecco / greetings : the 1999 genetic and evolutionary computation conference ( gecco ) would like to invite recent authors of papers related to genetic and evolutionary computation ( gec ) to become members of the program committee of the gecco conference to be held on july 13-17 , 1999 in orlando , florida . as you may know , the 1999 genetic and evolutionary computation conference ( gecco ) will be a combined meeting of the eighth international conference on genetic algorithms ( icga ) and the fourth annual genetic programming conference ( gp ) in cooperation with the american association for artificial intelligence ( aaai ) , parallel problem solving from nature ( ppsn ) steering committee , the international conference on evolvable systems ( ices ) steering committee , and other organizations and conferences to be announced . gecco will be held in lieu of icga-99 and gp-99 , and as such , it combines the oldest continuously running gec conference , and the two largest gec conferences . we believe that the gecco conference in 1999 will be a unique opportunity to bring together an exceptionally large number of people from all facets of genetic and evolutionary computation . being on the program committee will involve reading , reviewing , and ranking about half a dozen submitted papers on genetic and evolutionary computation or related areas during the month of february 1999 . ( the paper submission deadline for gecco-99 is wednesday , january 27 , 1999 ) . the willingness of active contributors to help the conference in this way is absolutely critical to the success of gecco . in the past , some have complained that their point of view has been excluded from the review process . by agreeing to join us , active gec researchers will help make the gecco review process fair , open , and broadly participatory . as part of the charter establishing this conference , extraordinary steps have been taken to ensure that ( 1 ) review representation is exceptionally broad and ( 2 ) the traditions , norms , and standards of the different flavors of gec are respected . let us take a brief moment to explain how this will be done . first , the charter of the conference says that reviewers are automatically invited based on their recent contribution of a peer-reviewed publication : a person may be a reviewer for the conference if he or she is an author of at least one peer-reviewed paper in a journal , conference proceedings book , or collected book of papers published since january 1 , 1995 involving any aspect or combinations of aspects of [ genetic and ] evolutionary computation . thus , becoming a reviewer is even-handedly based on recency of peer-reviewed contribution . second , gecco explicitly recognizes and respects the different traditions of different sub-fields within gec and related disciplines . as such , the conference has established six different tracks each with its own chair / editor : 1 . evolution strategies / evolutionary programming ( es / ep ) . a . e . eiben , gusz @ wi . leidenuniv . nl 2 . genetic algorithms / classifier systems ( ga / cs ) . robert e . smith , rsmith @ btc . uwe . ac . uk 3 . genetic programming / evolvable hardware ( gp / eh ) . wolfgang banzhaf ( also proceedings editor - in - chief ) , banzhaf @ ls11 . informatik . uni-dortmund . de 4 . artificial life , adaptive behavior , and agents ( aaa ) . vasant honavar , honavar @ cs . iastate . edu 5 . dna and molecular computing ( dna / mc ) . max h . garzon , mgarzon @ memphis . edu 6 . real - world applications ( rwa ) . mark jakiela , mjj @ mecf . wustl . edu these separate "" demes "" will establish separate rules and standards for paper acceptance based on the practices within the sub-discipline . in this way , we hope to more closely group "" birds of a feather "" and thereby avoid the rejection of high quality papers by reviewers who are less than familiar with the standards that should apply to a particular kind of paper . with this kind of carefully constructed process , we believe that a large number of recent gec authors will choose to join the program committee . if you are willing to be a member ( reviewer ) of the program committee , please email gecco @ aaai . org ( note : please do not use a "" reply "" command to respond to this message since dave goldberg will be out of town for most of june ) and send the following information : ( 1 ) the exact way you want your name listed , ( 2 ) the institutional affiliation you want listed with your name , ( 3 ) your physical mailing address , ( 4 ) your phone number ( for courier address labels ) , ( 5 ) your preferred e-mail address , ( 6 ) which of the six committees you would like to join ( gp / eh , ga / cs , or es / ep , aaa , dna / mc , or rwa ) , and if you have a preference for one of the sub-categories within that committee ( gp and / or eh , ga and / or cs , es and / or ep , alife and / or adaptive behavior and / or agents , dna and / or mc ) . ( 7 ) the title , date , and publication name of a peer-reviewed gec or related paper ( published after january 1 , 1995 ) that qualifies you as a member of the gecco committee ( a complete citation is unnecessary ) . authors who choose to join the gecco program committee will be acknowledged in the conference proceedings as well as in various editions of the calls for papers , the conference brochure , and advertising . physical copies of the papers will be sent to reviewers by ups courier service in late january 1999 , and the review form will be sent by e-mail . reviewers will be given several weeks to read and review the papers . reviews are returned by e-mail directly to the aaai . the reviewer 's name is removed from the message by the aaai before the review is forwarded to the chair of the appropriate track and ( eventually ) the submitting author . if a reviewer 's physical mailing address or e-mail address changes between now and february 1999 , the conference office ( gecco @ aaai . org ) should be notified as soon as possible . although the conference is over a year away , we already have an outstanding lineup of chairs , editors , senior members , and tutorial speakers ( see http : / / www-illigal . ge . uiuc . edu / gecco / ) . the editors / chairs have already been mentioned , but among those joining us as senior committee members are thomas baeck , hans - georg beyer , michael conrad , ingo rechenberg , guenter rudolph , bir bhanu , bill p . buckles , runwei cheng , marco colombetti , herbert dawid , marco dorigo , emanuel falkenauer , mitsuo gen , randy l . haupt , sue ellen haupt , john h . holland , kim f . man , dirk c . mattfeld , zbigniew michalewicz , melanie mitchell , k . s . tang , michael d . vose , david andre , vladan babovic , forrest h bennett iii , tobias blickle , dimitris c . dracopoulos , frank d . francone , andreas geyer - schulz , wolfgang a . halang , hitoshi iba , christian jacob , martin keane , robert e . keller , john r . koza , sam kwong , w . b . langdon , peter nordin , and moshe sipper . among those joining us for an extensive offering of tutorials are rik belew , forrest h bennett iii , lawrence davis , kalyanmoy deb , ken dejong , stephanie forrest , max garzon , tetsuya higuchi , john r . koza , w . b . langdon , jean - arcady meyer , melanie mitchell , randy c . murphy , peter nordin , i . c . parmee , guenter rudolph , hans - paul schwefel , leigh tesfatsion , michael vose , darrell whitley , and stewart wilson . other workshop and tutorial proposals as well as ideas for invited speakers and other activities may be sent to the business committee ( deg @ uiuc . edu or koza @ cs . stanford . edu ) . as active researchers ourselves , we understand that it is difficult to take time away from research for the "" administrivia "" of the reviewing process . but researchers are often the first to complain when their conferences are guided by "" political "" not "" scientific "" considerations . therefore we ask that all qualified committee candidates take this invitation very seriously , and we urge you to step up to the plate to make sure that the technical content of this conference is guided by our field 's active contributors ( qualified reviewers should send an email with the requested information above to gecco @ aaai . org ; please do not use a "" reply "" command to answer this message ) . names of reviewers who respond before july 1 , 1999 will be published in the first call for papers . moreover , we issue a special invitation to past authors to consider submitting to gecco 99 . although gecco is a new entity it is the combine of the oldest and the two largest , high-quality conferences in the field of genetic and evolutionary computation . with six separate demes for different styles of work and a participatory review process , we expect an unusually author-friendly conference . additionally , past attendance at icga and gp suggests that we should have over 600 researchers in attendance , but we will take steps to make sure that there is plenty of time for face-to - face meeting and interaction as well . in short , we believe that gecco-99 will be a special event for the community of genetic and evolutionary computation . we hope you can take the time to join us in the review process and we welcome your paper submission , but in any event we look forward to seeing you in orlando , july 13-17 , 1999 at gecco-99 . thank you , david e . goldberg ( illinois ) gecco-99 conference chair and business committee and john r . koza ( stanford ) gecco-99 business committee note : again , please do not use a "" reply "" command to answer this message . instead , respond to gecco @ aaai . org for fastest handling .",Safe Email

meaning multiple versions of the package can be installed at the same 
time. Yes the output is a bit strange.. especially when there's only one 
version available.'apt-get install kernel-source#2.4.18-3' will install it...--

chocolate flavoured pieces... :)Seriously, I can only see two reasons to start another distro: you have
something fundamentally different to offer, or you are customising an
existing distro for an unusual and specific situation. Between
Mandrake/YellowDog, RedHat/SuSe and Debian you have enough options to cover
most day-to-day requirements. And a lot of the specific situations are
already covered (smoothwall, familiar, etc.)Therefore, if I were to create a new Linux distribution, I would have to
spend time crafting it so that it offers a lot more than existing
alternatives. My requirements normally involve better support/easier
maintenance, and if one follows the logic through, this would require a
company to be behind such an initiative.I imagine it would be possible to create a new distribution in about one
week[1]. For example: take Debian as your base, slap a specific set of
packages on CD, change a few config files, mention that it has been untested
on most hardware variations, and voila, a ""new"" distie. :)- Matthew[1] That is, IT weeks. 1 IT week ~= two months. :)

"The pay's not good (9,300 a year), but there is insurance, a 4,700 (I 
think) off a student loan, or for future education, and non-compete status 
for any govt. job after a year's service.  I moved to New Orleans 
yesterday, and I should be flying to DC in about a month to start the 
AmeriCorps training.  I'll be setting up a community technology center which 
will be used to teach computer literacy skills to low income folks (just, 
like, learning MS shit (yeah yeah, wtf am i doing?  I know.))  so that 
they can possibly find better jobs.  I'm sure I'll be doing all sorts 
of other things too, like helping folks with their taxes, writing grants, 
etc.  The website is www.americorps.org.  There are -all- sorts of jobs 
all over the country, so if someone out there can survive on the small 
salary, it's something s/he might want to take a look at.  Since Xi is in college and getting grants + scholarship + child support 
from dad, my load has gone down terrifically.  The IRS is after me for 
money I didn't make on the stock market, so it's a way to at least get 
into a situation where they will have to understand that yes, they will 
have to wait.  But bottom line benefit and motivation is the feelgood that ya get when 
you do this type of job.  I'm up for some of that.

"Hello -You get emails every day, offering to show you how to make money.
Most of these emails are from people who are NOT making any money.
And they expect you to listen to them?Enough.If you want to make money with your computer, then you should
hook up with a group that is actually DOING it.  We are making
a large, continuing income every month.  What's more - we will
show YOU how to do the same thing.This business is done completely by internet and email, and you
can even join for free to check it out first.  If you can send
an email, you can do this.  No special ""skills"" are required.How much are we making?  Anywhere from $500 to $9000 per month.
We are real people, and most of us work at this business part-time.
But keep in mind, we do WORK at it - I am not going to 
insult your intelligence by saying you can sign up, do no work,
and rake in the cash.  That kind of job does not exist.  But if
you are willing to put in 10-12 hours per week, this might be
just the thing you are looking for.This is not income that is determined by luck, or work that is
done FOR you - it is all based on your effort.  But, as I said,
there are no special skills required.  And this income is RESIDUAL -
meaning that it continues each month (and it tends to increase
each month also).Interested?  I invite you to find out more.  You can get in as a
free member, at no cost, and no obligation to continue if you
decide it is not for you.  We are just looking for people who still
have that ""burning desire"" to find an opportunity that will reward
them incredibly well, if they work at it.To grab a FREE ID#, simply reply to: sj95@yahoo.com
and in the body of the email, write this phrase:
 
""Tim, enter my name for a free membership.""Be sure to include your:
1. First name
2. Last name
3. Email address (if different from above)We will confirm your position and send you a special report
as soon as possible, and also Your free Member Number.That's all there's to it.We'll then send you info, and you can make up your own mind.Looking forward to hearing from you!Sincerely, Tim HopkinsP.S. After having several negative experiences with network
marketing companies I had pretty much given up on them.
This is different - there is value, integrity, and a
REAL opportunity to have your own home-based business...
and finally make real money on the internet.Don't pass this up..you can sign up and test-drive the
program for FREE.  All you need to do is get your free
membership.Unsubscribing: Send a blank email to: sj95@yahoo.com with

"" and i think the responsibility on that lies with the palestinian authority . "" shortly after the first blast , a second explosion was heard in southern gaza , but its precise location was not immediately known . hamas , in a phone call to cnn , said it had set off the first explosion near rafah in cooperation with a group called the fatah hawks . there was no immediate information available on that group , although it was believed to be linked to the fatah movement formerly led by the late palestinian leader yasser arafat . israeli military sources said it was a coordinated attack , with palestinians firing mortar shells and guns at the post when the explosives were detonated . it was not clear whether there were palestinian casualties . news video of the aftermath showed soldiers using stretchers to transport troops who appeared to be severely wounded . in a pamphlet distributed after the attack , hamas said it had used 1 . 5 tons of explosives and had recorded video of the incident . palestinians have used tunnels in the area to smuggle weapons from egypt . israel has carried out operations to crack down on the smuggling . shell explosion in schoolyard an israeli tank shell exploded in a gaza schoolyard sunday morning , wounding eight palestinian schoolchildren , palestinian medical and security sources said . the children between the ages of 6 and 12 - - sustained moderate to light injuries , the sources said . the violence happened in khan yunis in central gaza israeli military sources said that forces in the area identified what they thought was a number of mortar shells being fired towards israeli settlements nearby . in response , the forces fired towards the positions with light weapons , but did not fire a tank shell , the military sources said .",Phishing Email

August 30, 2002 1:01 pm PTMAX LEVCHIN'S FASCINATION with encryption started when he was a teenager 
in Kiev, Ukraine, and continued as he immigrated to the United States 
where he attended the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. In 
late 1998, not two years out of college, he drew on his passion to 
co-found PayPal, the online payment system that has since attracted tens 
of millions of users and gained the reputation as the premier Internet 
transaction processor. Now online auction house eBay has acquired his 
company for a king's ransom.Not bad for a 27-year-old kid from Ukraine.A programmer since he was 10 years old, Levchin and his family moved to 
Chicago in 1991, and since then he has pursued security as if on a 
mission. He created a startup right out of college to build secure 
passwords for Palm Pilots. He met Peter Thiel, and the two founded 
PayPal to target online payment security. Thiel is now CEO of the 
company.""This company was founded on the notion of security value,"" Levchin 
says. ""Peter Thiel and I shared that vision from the very beginning.""Thiel concentrates on company business matters, whereas Levchin remains 
focused on security, which he says is the key to the company's good 
fortune.""I explain [PayPal] as a security company posing as a transaction 
processor,"" Levchin says. ""We spend a lot of time designing security so 
it doesn't step on the toes of convenience and not the other way around. 
The trade-off is fundamental.""Mountain View, Calif.-based PayPal allows businesses and consumers with 
e-mail addresses to send and receive payments via the Internet, 
accepting credit card or bank account payments for purchases. The 
service extends to 38 countries, with more than 17 million users and 
more than 3 million business accounts.Most of PayPal's users are participants in online auctions, which led 
PayPal to be closely linked with eBay, the leading Web auction site. 
Although they were once rivals, the relationship between the two 
companies resulted July 8 in eBay's tentative $1.5 billion acquisition 
of PayPal. The agreement is subject to regulatory review.Levchin says he will stay at PayPal as it merges with eBay. ""There are 
areas of synergy and collaboration we can explore.""Although security is a dominant feature for PayPal, the company's 
ability to carry out open communications among the millions of 
participants fits the growing Web services model, Levchin says.""This is a service that links people and allows them to send messages to 
one another,"" he says. Levchin is a panelist at InfoWorld's 
Next-Generation Web Services II conference Sept. 20PayPal, as an online payment system, is a natural target for fraud. And 
Levchin has almost singlehandedly saved the company from thieves bent on 
exploiting the system, says Avivah Litan, a vice president and analyst 
covering financial services at Stamford, Conn.-based Gartner.""If they didn't have Max, they might have succumbed, because PayPal was 
susceptible to fraud and money laundering, and Max tightened them up,"" 
Litan says.To combat criminals, Levchin established ""Igor,"" an antifraud program 
that monitors transactions and warns of suspicious accounts. Levchin 
says building security and antifraud systems is a job he relishes. ""The 
work I do is important to PayPal and to consumers in general because the 
work makes Internet shopping safe. It's the view that ecommerce has 
arrived.""

Date: Not suppliedThe Joint Hearing of the Senate Committee and Senate Select Committee on the 
Entertainment Industry is underway in LA, investigating artists' claims that 
the labels engage in unfair and corrupt business-practices. The first day's 
findings at the hearings are really quite remarkable:     By contract, artists are prohibited from showing royalty statements to 
    third parties. Normally this would not include their mangers, lawyers, 
    consultants, or others who could aid them in getting paid, but apparently 
    this is not necessarily the case. Senator Kevin Murray, leading the 
    initiative for artists' rights, claimed the that Cary Sherman, Chief 
    Counsel for the RIAA himself, said to him in an interview, that RIAA 
    members (the major labels) would sue any artist that broke ranks and shared 
    information with the Committee. This claim was rejected by Sherman but 
    supported by others in the room. Don Henley, among them, outwardly dared 
    his record company to sue him for bringing royalty statements to the 
    hearing. He presented his most recent royalty statement for ""Hell Freezes 
    Over,"" which showed the panel that even though his contract called for a no 
    more than a 10% ""reserve"" on sales of records shipped, Universal Music had 
    held back more than that for eleven pay periods (roughly under three years) 
    and that, even though his contract calls for no free goods in Europe, they 
    had deducted $87,000 in free goods charges to Europe.  Link[1] Discuss[2] (_Thanks, Paul!_)[1] http://www.musicdish.com/mag/?id=6675

"lexical semantic tagging lexical semantic tagging a special issue of the journal of natural language engineering guest editors : marc light and martha palmer call for papers note : deadline for submissions is november 1st , 1998 computing semantic representations is crucial for many applications of natural language processing . currently , semantic lexicons and sets of semantic composition rules are hand-crafted by the designers of the nlp system . the difficulty of building such hand-crafted semantic knowledge bases has limited the field of nlp to applications that can be contained within well-defined subdomains . the likely escape from this limitation will come from the use of automated or semi-automated methods of lexical acquisition . however , the field has yet to develop a clear consensus on a computational lexicon that could provide a springboard for such methods . one of the most controversial areas has to do with polysemy : what constitutes a clear separation into senses of a word , and how can they be computationally characterized and distinguished ? the answer to this question is critical to breaking the bottleneck of broad coverage semantic representation computation . a first step towards finding an answer lies in acquiring annotated corpora that will facilitate the use of empirical methods . the topic of this special issue is tagging word tokens in corpora with lexical semantic information . a concrete example of such tagging would be specifying the sense of an ambiguous word , like { \ em bank } , being used in a particular sentence in a corpus . lexical semantic tagging is critical to extending reliable co-reference for information extraction tasks , to widening the scope of responses to information retrieval queries , to more robust dialogue understanding , and to machine translation . in machine translation in particular , it is often necessary to disambiguate a polysemous source word in order to translate it correctly , since the target language may have distinct lexical items for different senses . we solicit articles which either : ( i ) discuss the characteristics of information to be tagged and how human tagging ( hand-tagging ) can be performed so as to maximize accuracy . such articles should concentrate on the specification of the task and also deal with issues in providing sufficient quantities of accurate and diverse hand-tagged data for the automatic approaches . ( ii ) discuss attempts to develop automated methods and their operation and performance . these articles should describe actual running systems and their design and implementation . we are particularly interested in discussions of lexical semantic tagging methods which are part of actual applications . format : in the interest of providing more coverage , we will be considering papers that are somewhat shorter than traditional journal papers . this would allow us to accept a maximum of 9 articles given an average length of 10 pages . schedule : november 1st , 1998 : submission deadline february 15th , 1999 : notification of acceptance please send submissions to : martha palmer institute for research in cognitive science 400a , 3401 walnut street / 6228 university of pennsylvania philadlephia , pa 19104 telephone : ( 215 ) 898-0361 fax no . : ( 215 ) 573-9247 e-mail : mpalmer @ cis . upenn . edu",Safe Email
"new books on human cognitive processing john benjamins publishing would like to call your attention to the following new title in the field of human cognitive processing : the contemporary theory of metaphor a perspective from chinese < br > ning yu the primary objective of this book is to contribute to the contemporary theory of metaphor from the viewpoint of chinese so as to help place the theory into a wider cross-linguistic and cross-cultural perspective . aiming at this primary objective , it explores two major questions faced by the contemporary theory : ( 1 ) if abstract reasoning is at least partially metaphorical in nature ; and ( 2 ) what conceptual metaphors are universal , widespread , or culture-specific . it focuses on ( 1 ) metaphors of emotions , ( 2 ) the time as space metaphor , and ( 3 ) the event structure metaphor . it studies how chinese is similar to and different from english with regard to these metaphor systems and image schemas involved , and what reasons ( cognitive or cultural ) can account for the similarities and differences between these two languages . in general , the empirical studies presented in this book reinforce the view that metaphor is the main mechanism through which abstract concepts are comprehended and abstract reasoning is performed . they also support , from the perspective of chinese , the candidacy of some conceptual metaphors for metaphorical universals . these include , for instance , the anger is heat metaphor , the happy is up metaphor , the time as space metaphor and the event structure metaphor . it seems that these conceptual metaphors are grounded in some basic human experiences that may be universal to all human beings . 1998 ca 300pp . human cognitive processing , 1 us / canada : hb : 1 55619 201 0 price : usd 59 . 00 rest of the world : hb : 90 272 2353 x price : nlg 118 bernadette martinez - keck publicity / marketing tel : ( 215 ) 836-1200 fax : ( 215 ) 836-1204 e-mail : bernie @ benjamins . com john benjamins north america po box 27519 philadelphia pa 19118-0519 check out the john benjamins web site : http : / / www . benjamins . com /",Safe Email

Zimbabwe eases GM stanceZimbabwe has dropped objections to accepting genetically modified (GM) grain
so that urgently-needed food aid can be delivered, says the UN food agency.
The executive director of the World Food Programme, James Morris, said
Zimbabwe's decision would send an important message to other countries in
the region which have refused food aid because it might contain GM grain.
Until now, Zimbabwe had said it would only allow aid workers to distribute
ground maize to allay fears that GM grain could be planted.
But a Zimbabwean minister says the government has now set up a system of
checks to ensure the grain will not enter the eco-system.
There have been fears that Southern African nations could lose lucrative
export markets in Europe if they cannot certify that their crops are
GM-free.
Aid
Mr Morris announced the policy reversal after talks in Harare with
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe.
""The fact that they have now concluded that they are comfortable in
accepting GM crops or commodities will be an important signal to other
countries in the region,"" Mr Morris told journalists.
""It will enable us to do our job,"" he said.
Aid workers say up to 13 million people in seven countries in Southern
Africa face famine. In Zimbabwe which was once the bread basket of the
region, some six million people are estimated to need food aid.
The WFP says it already has aid pledges for about half of the 600,000 tonnes
of food it intends to bring into Zimbabwe in the next few months.
The government blames the shortages solely on drought, but the government's
campaign to transfer land from large scale commercial white farmers has
worsened the situation, say many donors.
Lost markets
The GM row has complicated relief efforts across the region.
Zambia's president is refusing to overturn his ban on GM food aid, labelling
it as 'poison' .
Deals to mill GM food before being distributed, so that it could not be
planted, have placated fears in Malawi and Mozambique.
United States aid officials deny that the food is unsafe, pointing out that
Americans eat GM maize every day.
The World Health Organisation has certified the grain for human consumption
and says it does not constitute a danger to people's health.------------------------ Yahoo! Groups Sponsor ---------------------~-->

"update : ffvols ted , an update on the implementation for ffvols : ( 1 ) in comparing 6 days of historical var calculations ( with that of the implied ) for agg - gas , we have found that the historical var calculations are consistently lower over this period , by roughly 17 mm . the implied volatilities are much higher at this period , anticipating strong winter prices . ( 2 ) at this time , the consensus is not to relase the historical implementation into production , and the official line to traders will be that the method is still in testing . the historical var is 19 . 2 mm and the implied is 37 mm for effective date of 09 / 25 . ( 3 ) further testing is in progress on a hybrid methodology ( which i mentioned last week , whereby historical vols are scaled by the ratio of prompt to historical - prompt volatilities ) , to atleast capture some implied / forward effects . tanya ' s analysis on a fictitious portfolio indicates higher var numbers , but poorer backtesting in comparison to the historical approach . this approach serves as an intermediate , and seems appropriate in periods such as the current one , wherein the historical numbers might be considerably lower than those of the implied . ( 4 ) winston will start testing using these hybrid vols , and if the results are deemed satisfactory , that will be the production methodology . of course , we will obtain all var numbers concurrently to serve as different indicators and beacons of risk . the production number will hopefully be a sensible compromise of the different methods . regards naveen",Safe Email

Content Management Is Key: Need a reason your boss should be sending you to Gnomedex? Some of the leading experts on content management solutions (those things we affectionately call blogs) will be sharing the future of blogging and how you can adapt it to both the way you do business and the way you communicate in general. Join Evan Williams and Doc Searls as they share pearls of wisdom on blogging, Linux and other open source applications that are changing our lives. If that's not enough incentive, remind the boss that THE Internet security guru, Steve Gibson, will be sharing his wisdom as well. 
Register for Gnomedex today!   This year's SIC gets the blame for the 
lateness of this issue. Lori and I spent Wednesday thru Sunday meeting 
software authors, participating in educational sessions, viewing product 
demonstrations, and most of all having fun. This was Lori's second trip 
to an SIC conference, so she got to reacquaint herself with many familiar 
faces, while I was getting to put faces with many people I've exchanged 
e-mails with over the last several years. As much as I enjoy information 
exchange via computer, the human interaction of meeting people and 
sharing ideas and stories face-to-face is priceless.One cool discovery at this year's SIC, pertaining directly to Webmasters, 
is Nick Bradbury's release of 
TopStyle 3.0. 
Nick's the guy who created HomeSite, long before it joined the Macromedia 
family of products. Version 3 represents a return to those HTML editing 
roots, with the addition of editing capabilities now functioning 
hand-in-hand with the rock solid style sheet building features that 
previously defined  TopStyle. Conversion of existing font tags to CSS is 
just one of several new additions. I should have a full review in one of 
the next two issues.Also in the coming soon category - a GnomeTome on Cold Fusion, written by 
one of Iowa's resident ColdFusion experts (who also happens to be an 
expert on an International level), Kevin Schmidt. Kevin wrote the 
Training From the Source 
book on Cold Fusion 5 and is currently writing a revision for 
ColdFusionMX. The GnomeTome means we'll have a nice pairing of tips for 
both static pages, in the form of 
Dreamweaver tips, and tips on dynamic 
site development with Kevin's tips on ColdFusion.Jake LudingtonÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â GnomeMAIL

Making A Commercial Case for Adopting Web Standards
http://www.maccaws.com/Supporting standards and writing good code are often things that the number 
crunchers in a business don't feel are as important, when compared against 
getting the product to as many people as possible in the shortest amount of 
time possible in an effort to generate revenue. Communicating the 
importance of standards and good code can be an uphill battle; after all, 
you're just a programmer, right? MACCAWS aims to make your job easier, via 
an open discussion on the establishment of standards that will make sense 
to the folks who control the bottom line. Their mission is to educate 
business leaders by providing you the end user with tools that will help 
make a case for applying standards to your Web efforts. If you've got a 
voice you'd like to add to their cause, visit them on the Web and help 
  influence the course of Web standards development.Â GnomeBLOG

"idea!This could also be a job for P2P; lots of people would love to devote their spare cycles, bandwidth, and unblocked IP addresses to giving the Chinese unfettered net access.In a sense, this is what the ""peek-a-booty"" project does: http://www.peek-a-booty.orgBut let's play out the next few moves:Good Guys: Google enables SSL access Bad Guys: Chinese government again blocks all access to Google domains Good Guys: Set up Google proxies on ever-changing set of hosts (peek-a-booty) Bad Guys: Ban SSL (or any unlicensed opaque traffic) at the national firewall Good Guys: Hide Google traffic inside other innocuous-looking activity Bad Guys: Require nationwide installation of client-side NetNannyish software Good Guys: Offer software which disables/spoofs monitoring software Bad Guys: Imprison and harvest organs from people found using monitoring-disabling-software...and on and on.The best we can hope is that technological cleverness, by raising the costs of oppression or by provoking intolerable oppression, brings social liberalization sooner rather than later.- Gordon----- Original Message ----- From: ""Rohit Khare"" To: Sent: Monday, September 23, 2002 2:44 PM Subject: How about subsidizing SSL access to Google? [a cheeky letter to the editors of the Economist follows, along with the article I was commenting on... Rohit]In your article about Chinese attempts to censor Google last week (""The Search Goes On"", Sept. 19th), the followup correctly noted that the most subversive aspect of Google's service is not its card catalog, which merely points surfers in the right direction, but the entire library. By maintaining what amounts to a live backup of the entire World Wide Web, if you can get to Google's cache, you can read anything you'd like.The techniques Chinese Internet Service Providers are using to enforce these rules, however, all depend on the fact that traffic to and from Google, or indeed almost all public websites, is unencrypted. Almost all Web browsers, however, include support for Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption for securing credit card numbers and the like. Upgrading to SSL makes it effectively impossible for a 'man-in-the-middle' to meddle; censorship would have to be imposed on each individual computer in China. The only choice left is to either ban the entire site (range of IP addresses), but not the kind of selective filtering reported on in the article.Of course, the additional computing power to encrypt all this traffic costs real money. If the United States is so concerned about the free flow of information, why shouldn't the Broadcasting Board of Governors sponsor an encrypted interface to Google, or for that matter, the rest of the Web?To date, public diplomacy efforts have focused on public-sector programming for the Voice of America, Radio Sawa, and the like. Just imagine if the US government got into the business of subsidizing secure access to private-sector media instead. Nothing illustrates the freedom of the press as much as the wacky excess of the press itself -- and most of it is already salted away at Google and the Internet Archive project.On second thought, I can hardly imagine this Administration *promoting* the use of encryption to uphold privacy rights. Never mind...Best, Rohit Khare===========================================================The search goes on China backtracks on banning Googleâ€”up to a pointSep 19th 2002 | BEIJING From The Economist print editionIN CHINESE, the nickname for Google, an American Internet search engine, is gougou, meaning â€œdoggyâ€. For the country's fast-growing population of Internet users (46m, according to an official estimate), it is proving an elusive creature. Earlier this month, the Chinese authorities blocked access to Google from Internet service providers in Chinaâ€”apparently because the search engine helped Chinese users to get access to forbidden sites. Now, after an outcry from those users, access has been restored.An unusual climbdown by China's zealous Internet censors? Hardly. More sophisticated controls have now been imposed that make it difficult to use Google to search for material deemed offensive to the government. Access is still blocked to the cached versions of web pages taken by Google as it trawls the Internet. These once provided a handy way for Chinese users to see material stored on blocked websites.After the blocking of Google on August 31st, many Chinese Internet users posted messages on bulletin boards in China protesting against the move. Their anger was again aroused last week when some Chinese Internet providers began rerouting users trying to reach the blocked Google site to far less powerful search engines in China.Duncan Clark, the head of a Beijing-based technology consultancy firm, BDA (China) Ltd, says China is trying a new tactic in its efforts to censor the Internet. Until recently, it had focused on blocking individual sites, including all pages stored on them. Now it seems to be filtering data transmitted to or from foreign websites to search for key words that might indicate undesirable content. For example earlier this week when using Eastnet, a Beijing-based Internet provider, a search on Google for Falun Gongâ€”a quasi-Buddhist exercise sect outlawed in Chinaâ€” usually aborted before all the results had time to appear. Such a search also rendered Google impossible to use for several minutes.",Safe Email

Yes, and the working class deserves what it gets, and possibly not even
that.  For the most part, people become wealthy by not being stupid.  I
always thought ""not being stupid (most of the time)"" was a fairly low
bar, but apparently most people can't even manage that.That is really what it all boils down to:  There are lots of ignorant
and/or stupid people who are quite happy to stay that way, and it is a
key causal factor in why things are the way they are.  What are you
going to do about it?

currently have an email server named, say, mail.comcast.net, with user name

tells it the user name is.This is an N-way classifier (like ifile that way), and ""all it does"" is
insert a    X-Text-Classification:  one_of_the_class_names_you_pickedheader into your email before passing it on to your mail reader.  The user
then presumably fiddles their mail reader to look for such headers and ""do

"review : torrego , the dependencies of objects . torrego , esther , ( 1998 ) , the dependencies of objects . linguistic inquiry monograph 34 . cambridge , massachusetts : the mit press . 197 pages . reviewed by alex alsina , universitat pompeu fabra ( barcelona ) . this book is a study of overtly case-marked objects in spanish that pays attention to similar phenomena in other languages , particularly other romance languages . it is well-known that direct objects , or accusative objects , in spanish , when expressed as full nps , or dps ( to use the author 's term ) , alternate between two forms depending on various semantic and syntactic properties : dps withouth any overt case morphology , and overtly case-marked dps . the overt case marker in question is the preposition "" a "" , which also marks dative objects . the study adopts the minimalist program , outlined by chomsky ( 1992 , 1994 , 1995 ) , as a framework for developing an analysis for the various phenomena under investigation . synopsis chapter 1 outlines the theoretical framework of the book and sketches the content of the subsequent chapters . chapter 2 presents the various generalizations that characterize spanish accusative objects marked by the dative preposition . among these generalizations are correlations between overt case-marking and specificity , between overt case-marking and telicity , between overt case-marking and an interpretation of the subject as an agent or a cause , etc . the common element in the explanation of all of these generalizations is the idea that the marked accusative object raises overtly to a position outside vp , to the specifier position of the functional category v , which takes the vp as its complement . for example , the two following facts are observed : marked accusative requires ( or may require ) a telic interpretation of the event which is absent with unmarked accusative objects , and an affected interpretation of the ( animate ) object requires overt case-marking on the object . it is suggested that objects moved outside the vp have a delimiting role for their predicates and , at the same time , the position to which objects moved , the spec of vp , is the locus of affectedness . thus , two different properties of overt case-marking would be made to follow from the idea that overtly case-marked objects in spanish undergo overt movement to spec of vp . likewise , the observation that overt case-marking on the object requires the subject to be interpreted as an agent or as a cause is linked to the idea that an overtly case-marked object is in spec-v p and to the hypothesis that the causative or agent role is assigned to the v - vp configuration . torrego proposes that there are two types of marked accusatives , one with structural case and the other with inherent case . marked accusative is inherent with causative and agentive verbs and those with affected objects , and is structural with other verbs . this theoretical difference is appealed to in order to account for an asymmetry with respect to extraction out of marked accusative objects : such extractions are ill-formed with the former class of verbs , but not with the latter . the presence of the extra structure created by the inherent case marker is a crucial element in the explanation of this contrast . chapter 3 examines variation in causative structures in spanish and argues that this variation is largely conditioned by case assignment . much of the discussion is based on a causative structure in which the causee appears between the causative verb "" hacer "" ' make ' and the infinitive . one of the goals of the chapter is to explain the restrictions on the "" faire-par "" causative in several spanish dialects . in these dialects , the "" faire-par "" causative is only fully acceptable in the following situations : ( 1 ) when an object clitic is present , or ( 2 ) when a reflexive clitic is present , and that , otherwise they are best with verbs identified as "" constructive accomplishments "" such as ' build ' or with case-marked objects . chapter 4 analyzes constructions with dative objects , both with ditransitive verbs and with unaccusatives . restrictions regarding constructions with two objects with identical case-marking are examined . the chapter also deals with contrasts between the presence and absence of doubling clitics . a comparison is made with the double object constructions in english . an analysis is presented of the contrast in raising constructions with 's eem ' between those without the dative argument ( acceptable ) and those with it ( unacceptable ) . conclusions are briefly summarized at the end . critical discussion this book is a mine of linguistic puzzles concerning objects , causative constructions , clitics , and related phenomena in spanish . it is of interest to anyone concerned with these matters , regardless of what analysis and what theoretical framework one may wish to adopt . this book is also of interest to linguists who want to find out how the minimalist program can be applied to a particular empirical domain . the author has done a great job of synthesizing the data and presenting generalizations that need to be explained . despite these positive aspects of the book , i experienced serious frustrations while reading it having to do with the data and with the analysis . data the problem with the data , which is a minor one compared to the other one , has to do with the fact that many of the data presented are alien to the varieties of spanish that i speak or am familiar with . naturally , i cannot claim to know all varieties of spanish , so i should not be surprised to discover data that do not belong to the spanish that i know . some examples follow . torrego presents a contrast in pp . 58-59 between "" a quienes ( les ) vieron ? "" and "" a quienes ( * los ) vieron ? "" , but both forms are equally ill-formed for me when the clitic ( the form in parentheses ) is included . the example "" la guerra los hizo subir "" in page 101 is claimed to allow only an animate reading for the clitic "" los "" , although for me it also allows an inanimate reading , but then this fact is claimed to hold only in spanish dialects where the pre-infinitival causee with "" hacer "" and an intransitive verb is attested , and i find this causative structure highly marginal ( examples such as "" la maestra hizo a los alumnos subir "" ) . and the construction exemplified by sentences such as "" me hizo pedir yo , "" which is analyzed in this book , is also alien to me . the main problem with these numerous discrepancies about the data is that it makes it hard to evaluate when a difference in the interpretation of the data is due to a difference in the data ( that may not be obvious ) or to a possible misanalysis of what actually is the same data . to illustrate this , consider the argument given in support of the claim that the structure embedded under "" hacer "" in a sentence like "" la guerra hizo subir los precios "" is a single unit ( p . 102 ) . torrego claims that standard constituency tests indicate that the sequence "" subir los precios "" in this sentence is a constituent and provides examples such as the following in support of this claim : ( 38 ) a . lo que la guerra hizo es subir los precios . what the war caused is to rise the prices d . que ha hecho la guerra sino subir los precios ? what has the war caused except rising the prices ? for me the translation of these sentences is not as indicated in the glosses , but rather as "" what the war did is to raise the prices . "" and "" what has the war done but raise the prices ? "" for ( 38a ) and ( 38d ) respectively . i would tend to believe that torrego is playing on the polysemy of "" hacer "" and "" subir "" . "" hacer "" can be either the causative verb meaning ' cause ' or ' make ' or the generic transitive verb translatable as 'd o ' , and "" subir "" can be either intransitive , equivalent to ' rise ' , or transitive , equivalent to ' raise ' . for the examples in ( 38 ) to be relevant to torrego 's claim , "" hacer "" must be causative and "" subir "" intransitive . what makes these exemples acceptable ( even though not perfect ) for me is that "" subir "" can be taken to be a transtive verb , whose unexpressed subject is coreferential with "" la guerra "" . but , under this interpretation , "" hacer "" would not be functioning as the causative verb , but as the counterpart of 'd o ' . what shows conclusively that , in my variety of spanish , this interpretation is right is that , if , instead of "" subir "" , we use a verb that only has an intransitive use , we get an unacceptable result . "" caer "" ' fall ' is such a verb : even though the sequence "" caer los precios "" can appear following the causative verb "" hacer "" , as in "" la guerra hizo caer los precios , "" it cannot appear as a focused or topicalized constituent of this verb , as we see in ( i ) . ( i ) a . * lo que la guerra hizo es caer los precios . what the war did / caused is to fall the prices b . * que ha hecho la guerra sino caer los precios ? what has the war done / caused except falling the prices ? > from this i would conclude that torrego 's data in ( 38 ) do not provide any evidence for the claim that a sequence such as "" subir los precios "" in a causative construction is a constituent , because those examples do not include the causative verb "" hacer "" . of course , i can only reach this conclusion for the variety of spanish that i am familiar with , where ( i ) is ungrammatical . but , for all i know , the examples in ( i ) could be grammatical in the variety of spanish analyzed by torrego , in which case my conclusion would not apply and the examples in ( 38 ) would constitute relevant evidence for the claim under investigation . analysis my second difficulty with this book is in the analysis ( or analyses ) provided . i have trouble understanding many of the analyses given : in many cases , i fail to derive the predictions that should follow from the analysis , i cannot tell what would constitute a counterexample to the analysis , i cannot figure out what role a given assumption plays in the analysis , etc . this could well be due to a deficiency on my part , but other readers might experience the same difficulties . next , i will point out some problem cases . 1 . chapter 2 of the book starts out with a list of six generalizations about marked accusative ( pp . 14-16 ) : ( 1 ) marked accusative can cooccur with doubling clitics in some dialects ( it is a necessary condition for clitic doubling ) , ( 2 ) marked accusative objects are interpreted as specific , ( 3 ) telicity requires marked accusative ( with animate objects ) , ( 4 ) the subject in a clause with a marked accusative object is an agent or a cause , ( 5 ) marked accusative is restricted to animates , and ( 6 ) affected animate objects require marked accusative . the indications given all along are that these generalizations will follow from a unified analysis . the main idea underlying this analysis is that an object with marked accusative raises to the specifier position of the functional category v , which takes a vp as its complement . ideally , an overt movement operation of this kind should have some testable effects on word order and all of the properties of the construction should follow straightforwardly from this operation . however , as torrego notes , there is no visible effect of object raising on word order , so that the motivation for the analysis rests entirely on how well it explains the generalizations listed above . and these generalizations are explained by attributing the various properties that correlate with overt case-marking to the spec of v - vp position on a one-by - one basis . for example , it is proposed that the spec of v - vp has a specific interpretation , that the presence of an object in spec of v - vp may shift the aspect of the predicate to a telic situation , that the presence of an object in spec of v - vp gives an agentive interpretation to the subject , etc . one wonders why this analysis should be preferable to one that attributes all of these properties directly to overt case-marking : in both cases , a one-by - one stipulation of those properties is required . it is not clear what the advantage is in attributing these properties to a special phrase structure position for which very weak evidence is given . 2 . in pp . 23 ff , torrego claims that there are two types of marked accusative : marked accusative of non-affected objects is structural case , whereas marked acusative of affected objects is inherent case . however , this claim is faced with a major problem that torrego notes , but then simply disregards . inherent ( or quirky ) case has the generally accepted property that it is preserved under passivization : an argument with inherent case does n't lose or change its case marking when its clause is passivized . genitive and dative case in icelandic are a good example of this , and dative case in spanish is also a good example of case marking that does not change from active to passive . however , the marked accusative case of affected objects in spanish is not preserved ( see relevant examples in p . 28 ) . torrego notes that , in contrast with spanish , some hindi dialects preserve the accusative "" - ko "" marking in passives , citing mohanan 1990 . torrego then goes on to say ( p . 29 ) : "" if the marked accusative of "" affected "" objects were inherent , overt marking in passivization could be preserved ( just as the marking of datives and genitives is preserved in icelandic passives ) . it remains to be seen whether relevant data from the dialects of hindi confirm this expectation . "" but the relevant data from the dialects of hindi does confirm this expectation , as the examples from mohanan 1990 ( also mohanan 1994 ) show . if we agree that we identify inherent case because its case marking is preserved under passivization , then we must conclude that marked accusative case is inherent in some dialects of hindi , because its case marking does not change under passivization , but is structural in the other dialects of hindi , where it does change under passivization . and we are forced to conclude that it is structural in spanish because it is not preserved under passivization . to ignore this evidence and still conclude that marked accusative case can be inherent case in spanish is to devoid the distinction between structural case and inherent case of the conceptual and empirical substance that it is standardly asociated with . and torrego does not explicitly reject this association . 3 . the agentivity effect of clauses with marked accusative is explained as follows : following a suggestion of chomsky 's ( 1995 ) , the causative or the agent role can be understood as the interpretation assigned to the v - vp configuration ; since marked accusative is assigned to objects that raise to spec of vp , the presence of marked accusative implies the existence of the v - vp configuration . therefore , whenever there is marked accusative , there must be an agentive or causative interpretation . but what happens with verbs that allow an alternation between marked and unmarked accusative on the object ? this should mean that such verbs should alternate between a v - vp configuration and some other configuration , but this second option is not spelled out . also , we have no way of knowing what consequences the presence or absence of the v - vp configuration has other than on overt case marking and on the corelation between overt case marking and other properties such as agentivity . 4 . in pp . 34 ff . , torrego tries to relate the idea that marked accusative on affected objects is lexical quirky case to grimshaw 's ( 1990 ) theory of quirky case - marking . in grimshaw 's theory , arguments at argument structure are ranked by prominence in two tiers : the aspectual tier and the thematic tier . adopting this theory , torrego proposes ( p . 36 ) that "" an argument ( subject or object ) can be lexically or quirky marked when it has thematic or aspectual prominence relative to the other argument . "" it is unclear how one is to interpret this proposal . prominence is a comparative property : a is more or less prominent than b . to say that a has prominence relative to b is either meaningless or would be true of any pair of arguments in an argument structure : it is necessarily true of any pair of arguments a and b of an argument structure that a is in a prominence relation to b . torrego goes on to state : "" the two arguments of an agentive telic transitive verb are both aspectually prominent . "" but this should be true of all transitive verbs . torrego goes on to conclude : "" this approach covers the fact that the object of only agentive and caustive verbs can or must be lexically or quirky case - marked , and also covers the fact that the overall phenomenon of marked accusative case happens with verbs that have agentive subjects . "" i fail to see how these predictions are derived . 5 . regarding the animacy restriction on overtly case - marked objects , torrego proposes that the term "" actor "" is more appropriate to characterize the class of nominals that appear in marked accusative than the term "" animate "" . the motivation for this terminological change is found in the existence of some expressions denoting inanimate entities that can take overt case - marking , as in the following example ( p . 55 ) : ( 45 ) el acido afecta ( a ) los metales . ' acid affects metals . ' ( i suspect that the presence of marked accusative in this example has more to do with the verb than with the semantics of the object . ) torrego does not propose a definition of "" actor "" , but refers the reader to jackendoff 's ( 1983 ) characterization of "" actor "" as the character in an action-type event that performs the action . given this characterization , it is hard to see how "" los metales "" ' the metals ' in example ( 45 ) can be interpreted as the argument that performs the action of the event ; what would "" el acido "" ' the acid ' be , then ? torrego goes on to say : "" the distinction between "" animates "" ( or "" actor "" - like nominals ) and "" inanimates "" does not appear to be semantic in nature . "" this is an odd claim to make , given that the notion of "" actor , "" which is proposed to replace "" animate , "" is given a semantic characterization . the motivation for this claim , however , is found in the fact that certain expressions , specifically proper names of humans , can be used to refer to anything , from a boat to a magazine to a can of beer , and always require overt case morphology , as in the following example : ( 46 ) esconde * ( a ) barbara . ' hide barbara . ' it is suggested that a purely morphological property underlies overt case - marking , although no indication is given as to what this morphological property might be . possibly the most robust generalization about overt case - marking of objects in spanish is that it is restricted to "" animates "" , even though there are problem cases such as example ( 45 ) and "" personified "" expressions such as ( 46 ) . because of these problems , torrego gives no explanation for the correlation between case - marking and animate interpretation and between absence of case - marking and inanimate interpretation that we see in pairs such as ( ii ) and ( iii ) : ( ii ) a . esconde a este . ( ' hide this one ( male animate entity ) . ' ) b . esconde este . ( ' hide this one ( inanimate entity ) . ' ) ( iii ) a . veremos a otra . ( ' we shall see another one ( female animate entity ) . ' ) a . veremos otra . ( ' we shall see another one ( inanimate entity ) . ' ) general remarks torrego often appeals to intuition in the exposition of the analysis and does not work out the details of the analysis . the following remark , very reminiscent of chomsky 's style , illustrates this point ( p . 139 , end of 3rd par . ) : "" whatever the details of this intuitive account are , the general approach seems quite plausible . "" if one does not work out the details of an account , it is not possible to derive predictions from it , and therefore the theory is unfalsifiable . this work by torrego is part of a move towards deriving explanations from very general and simple principles that interact in complex ways with each other . this move is a welcome one , but we should be careful that it does not land us in vagueness and imprecision . there is a style of explanation in which appeal is made to principles , often unstated or imprecisely stated principles , from which predictions are claimed to follow , but in which the derivation of predictions ( the logical steps from which predictions follow ) is not worked out and it is not possible to know what a prediction of the theory really is and what a counterexample to the theory might be . there is a danger that a reader of torrego 's "" the dependencies of objects "" might have the impression that the explanations in this book are of this style . to prevent this impression , torrego should have made a greater effort in terms of exposition ( even if it means leading the reader by the hand ) to show how the various predictions are derived . for that , it is necessary to state the crucial principles explicitly , as numbered items so the reader can refer to them easily , to make the assumptions about representations also explicit , and to give step-by - step derivations of the various predictions . references chomsky , noam . 1992 . a minimalist program for linguistic theory . mit working papers in linguistics , no . 1 . chomsky , noam . 1994 . bare phrase structure . mit occasional papers in linguistics , no . 5 . chomsky , noam . 1995 . the minimalist program . mit press . grimshaw , jane . 1990 . argument structure . mit press . jackendoff , ray . 1983 . semantics and cognition . mit press . mohanan , tara . 1990 . arguments in hindi . ph . d . dissertation , stanford university . mohanan , tara . 1994 . argument structure in hindi . stanford : csli publications . reviewer : alex alsina , professor titular d ' universitat , faculty of translation and interpretation , universitat pompeu fabra , barcelona , spain . ph . d . , stanford university , 1993 . research interests include syntax , morphology , morphosyntax , argument structure , linguistic theory . reviewer 's address : alex alsina facultat de traduccio i interpretacio universitat pompeu fabra la rambla , 30-32 08002 barcelona spain alex . alsina @ trad . upf . es",Safe Email

"Hi,Red Hat 8.0 is released tomorrow (monday).  I took some time out to make 
RPMs of GStreamer for it.All of them (core, plugins and player) have been uploaded to the apt 
repository in a new ""redhat-80-i386"" directory.The repository for dependencies is again called ""deps"", and the one for 
the gstreamer rpms is ""redhat"", because this time around the base distro 
contains all the necessary packages.A screenshot of Red Hat 8.0 running gst-player is up at
http://thomas.apestaart.org/download/screenshots/redhat-80-gst-player.png
Here are some known issues with the resulting rpms :a) gstreamer-nautilus isn't built, the package got renamed and I don't 
have a -devel package for it yetb) the c++ plugins have problems which I haven't been able to resolve.
Here are the errors:INFO (15299: 0)gst_xml_registry_rebuild:1555: Plugin

"URL: http://www.joelonsoftware.com/news/20020910.html
Date: Not suppliedDaniel Berlinger has noticed[1] that Mac software shops are starting to move to 
OS X-only development. This makes sense, for two reasons. First, most people 
who pay for software have new computers. So while OS X may only have a small 
fraction of the installed base, it has the majority of the population of people 
who are opening their wallets. Second, if OS X isn't successful, the Mac is _
over_. It's not like System 9 is getting any more popular. Then again, there are very few conditions under which it is actually the right 
business decision to develop software for the Macintosh. Developing for the Mac 
is not a whole lot different than creating a web site _that only works on 
Netscape_. (Given the market share of Macs[2] (about 3.5%) and the market share 
of Netscape[3] (about 3.4%), that is not a silly comparison.) Robb Beal wrote[4]: ""Try this test. Go to a venture firm, angel, or big company 
with a Mac OS X product/concept/prototype. Do they consider the fact that it's 
a Mac application a net plus? (No.)"" Well _duh_. Your product would have to 
appeal to _25 times more Mac _users_ _[as a percentage] than Windows users just 
to break even. In other words, if your Windows product appeals to 1 in 100 
Windows users, you have to appeal to 25 in 100 Mac users to make the same 
amount of money. Now, you may want to make an _emotional_ appeal to developing for the Mac. 
That's fine. If you like Macs and you're doing it for fun, more power to ya. But as long as we're talking _investment_, you have to tell me why you're going 
to get 25 times as many users. Maybe there's less competition in your category 
on the Mac; maybe you're in a niche like graphics where it seems like Macs 
dominate (they don't, it just seems that way because the elite graphics people 
in big American cities use Macs); maybe your product can't sell to mixed 
environments unless it runs everywhere. But if you want to make an investment 
in Mac software be prepared to demonstrate how you're going to overcome that 
magic 25 multiplier.[1] http://archipelago.phrasewise.com/2002/09/10

today!I don't usually spend much time explaining metaphors. They are, after all, 
metaphorical. They can be filled with whatever symbolism you choose. Written 
well, we all come to some similar understanding of their meaning. But, I'll 
depart today, contrary to my normal practice, to take a few minutes explaining a 
recent metaphor.I'm a Linux guy through and through. As a user, I see myself as right about at 
the average on the curve. For love of the language and open source attitude, 
though, you'd be hard-pressed to find anyone with quite the same level of 
enthusiasm. Put simply, there's very little about the Linux and broader open 
source worlds that I don't like or believe in.Take, for example, the practice of recursive acronyms. GNU (""Gnu's Not Unix""), 
HURD (""Herd of Unix-Replacing Daemons""), WINE (""Wine Is Not an Emulator""), even 
PHP (""PHP Hypertext Processor"") - all carry on the tradition of recursion in the 
Unix/Linux world. Goofy as it sounds, I love this stuff.So it is that I set out to create a recursive metaphor last week. It could only 
have happened on or about the 4th of July. In fact, it happened in the edition 
of the 3rd. I wrote a piece about how we Americans spend more time over the 
course of a year talking about what's wrong with our system than what's 
right. I wrote it knowing full well that many of the responses I'd get would be 
a) from readers outside the US and b) in sharp disagreement to my comments or 
those of citizens of other countries. You're following me, right? People would 
disagree with an article that said we spend much time disagreeing. This, of 
course, would prove my point in a somewhat metaphorical way - the perfect 
recursive metaphor. The point was to be made yet more perfectly by the eventual 
inclusion in Penguin Shell of the comments of someone from outside the US 
disagreeing with my take our argumentativeness as Americans. Ideally, they would 
be comments that disagreed with our collective American perception of being 
disagreeable. They would, of course, point out things about which citizens of 
other countries can disagree with Americans on. By exercising the right to 
disagree, we'd subtly agree that we have that right. Yet another level of 
recursion and a final layer of metaphor.The response to both my own and Johan Sauviller's comments was overwhelming. In 
the main, I believe both were appreciated. Many commented on the balance of the 
two pieces. Some readers were surprised, I think, to see a dissenting opinion 
published so quickly, if at all. Overall, the ability to express honestly held 
opinions, to agree and to disagree on a global level closed the circle on the 
metaphor in a perfect way.Things have, however, gotten a bit more ugly in the past few days. I'm not sure 
whether some were slow in getting to the July 3rd issue, or whether it's just 
been stewing since then. Take, for instance, these comments by a reader who will 
remain mercifully nameless:
We get enough
America bashing from our left-wing whacko extremist press and schools here
in the USA that we don't wish to hear some (insert favorite adjective here)
from Belgium whining too!
Followed by:
... please don't let Tony single-handedly tarnish the fine reputation
of Lockergnome. I'm sure there are other articulate Linux experts out there who 
would be able to replace him.
... and, in a later note on the topic ...
Censorship is to be encouraged in a
free-market society whenever and wherever it doesn't come from the
government.
Clearly, the metaphor just whizzed right over the heads of some.
Chris 
has been great about allowing all his authors plenty of room in the editorial 
piece at the beginning of each newsletter. This particular piece is no 
exception. He's shown a quiet confidence in the face of some very shrill 
comments. While we all generally stay focused on technical issues, Chris has 
shown unwavering support for the notion that we geeks are, in the end, humans 
with opinions and thoughts to share. I think it's one of the things that makes 
the Lockergnome newsletters stand out from the pack - the personal touch.So, despite the irrationality of some of this week's comments, I'll continue to 
occasionally throw in a personal aside with the technical stuff.Just watch out. Recursive metaphors are only funny until someone puts an eye 
out.

your set TODAY, ONLY $29.95!Win Apps in Linux?Yesterday, I mentioned an interesting review of two products for Linux by CodeWeavers - CrossOver 
Office and CrossOver Plugin. You've probably heard of both by now, as they've 
garnered quite a bit of publicity both in and out of the Linux world. You'll 
recall that I promised to try to secure copies for review this week. With the 
help of a friendly sales rep at CodeWeavers, I was able to accomplish that task 
this morning. True to the second half of the promise, we'll spend the next few 
days looking at these two products and how they might impact your Linux use. 
Let's take them in chronological order, starting today with CrossOver Plugin.A bit of background is in order. CodeWeavers is, in their own words, "" ... the 
leading corporate backer of the Wine Project. Wine has been, for the past several years, an 
ongoing project to port Windows applications to Linux. It's a tough goal, but 
it's also one that's been undertaken by others in the past year or so. Though the progress has been 
slow, the Wine project has managed to stay at the front of this development 
realm.
CrossOver 
Plugin marks a change in the philosophy of the Wine Project. Prior to its 
release, Wine had taken a ""full system"" approach. Running Windows applications 
in Wine required the installation of a sizeable daemon and no small amount of 
configuration work. CrossOver Plugin has moved Wine away from the system-wide 
approach to one that's much more modular. Rather than executing at system 
startup, Wine is called as-needed, with the virtual Windows path to the called 
program. When the program is closed, so is Wine. CrossOver Plugin has focused on creating Linux functionality with one related set of Windows 
applications: browser plugins.The results stand as a clear indication that the change in philosophy is a 
success. Off the top, CrossOver Plugin bundles QuickTime 5, Windows Media Player 6.2, Shockwave 8.5, Flash 6, and RealPlayer 8 into a Linux-accesible browser 
plugin package. Throw in more esoteric apps like IPix, Trillian, Authorware Web 
Player 6 and eFax Messenger 2, and you've got virtually every need plugin need 
covered.But this package doesn't stop there. Included in the CrossOver Plugin package 
are viewers for Word, Excel and Powerpoint, as well as several 
Microsoft-oriented fonts. Honestly, I was stunned at the range of applications 
offered by the CodeWeavers developers.Having had some experience with Wine, I was a bit leery about the install 
process and about the ability to get all these great applications to work with 
my RedHat setup. I've never been completely successful with Wine, but I hoped 
for the best when I started the CrossOver Plugin installation. I really did want these apps to work.The installation was quite easy. By running the install-crossover.sh script from the command line, I was able to install the installers for both CrossOver Plugin and CrossOver Office, which we'll talk about tomorrow. I started the plugin 
installs with QuickTime, a tool I've admittedly missed in Linux. In the 
background, CrossOver Plugin had already created a virtual C:\ drive on my 
machine. I clicked on the QuickTime install and immediately saw a familiar sight - the Vise installer in its Windows format. CrossOver Plugin first checked for 
feedback from the Windows binary, opened a virtual Windows window, then stepped 
out while the Vise installer took care of the rest. Though the install failed 
four times, it appeared to be a server failure rather than a failure of the 
CrossOver program. I kept ""retry""ing and, with some persistence, managed to get 
a full QuickTime 5 install downloaded from the Apple servers. Quite literally, 
the install looked and performed exactly as I've seem many times in Windows. 
When the install was completed, CrossOver again checked for the Windows binary, 
located the appropriate .dll files in the virtual C:\ drive and dropped the 
plugins into the /home/tony/.netscape/plugins and /home/tony/.mozilla/plugins 
directories.The process was so smooth that I had to check the plugin listings in these 
browsers - ""Help"", ""About Plugins."" Sure enough, the CrossOver QuickTime plugin 
was listed. Quickly, I ran out to the Apple site and opened the ""Men In Black 
II"" movie trailer. QuickTime performed flawlessly.I followed with the Windows Media Player, Shockwave, Flash, IPix, and eFax 
Messenger installs. Of those, the only ones that weren't self-contained in the 
CrossOver install were IPix and eFax. Even at that, the installer pointed me to 
the Windows download then found the .exe file when the download was done. Within a half-hour, I had all installed and tested.Then, just for grins, I installed RealPlayer 8 via CrossOver. This was despite 
the recommendation in the installer screen to use the Linux version. It went as 
smoothly as the others with one caveat - the player played media files at a much faster speed than that in Windows. Fast enough to make me laugh, in fact, 
reminded of Dave and Alvin the Chipmunk. Ah well, six out of seven is pretty 
strong given my previous troubles with Wine.I also installed a few fonts - Arial, Times New Roman, Trebuchet, and Veranda. 
In every case, the install was quick and absolutely painless.Wine has always held great promise. At times, it's been painful to watch the 
tedious pace of development, only because that promise was so alluring. With the backing of CodeWeavers and a fundamental change in the approach to development, 
Wine has finally realized the goal of integrating Windows applications 
seamlessly into the stable Linux environment. The results are so strong that, if I didn't know better, I'd swear that a few of these plugins actually run better 
in Linux than in their native Windows. Honestly, I didn't realize how much I 
missed them until I started using them in Linux today.Tomorrow holds a few surpirses, with a look at CodeWeavers' CrossOver Office 
package.

Kernel Configuration - Part IXWe're nine parts into the kernel configuration series, with quite a bit yet to 
go. If you haven't been following along, we're breaking out the configuration 
screens one at a time in an attempt to shed some light on the purpose and 
function of each. With that knowledge, you should be able to make a clear 
decision as to how to configure each section.Today, it's the Parallel Port support section. This is pretty simple. If you 
need parallel port support - such as for a printer - select this option either 
as a driver built into the kernel or as a loadable module.Most will use the PC-style hardware option in conjuction with a Windows printer. But that's not all the parallel port can be used for. As an example, the builds 
I did with the telescope company required parallel port support, as the 
telescope cameras were attached to this port.Be aware - this kernel configuration option only makes a driver available for 
the parallel port. The computer's BIOS sets the mode for the port - ECP, EPP, or Auto. On the majority of modern computers, the Auto mode is the default and will work just fine. However, if you have problems communicating with your printer 
following a kernel recompile, try changing the mode of your printer in the 
BIOS.Tomorrow, it's Plug and Play configuration.

Netics 2.0http://www.citi.umich.edu/u/marius/netics/""Netics is an extensible network statistics collector. It puts the network 
interface in promiscuous mode and reads the data stream (after it strips off the appropriate protocol headers), then displays the results at specified intervals, either in a ""progress bar"" mode or as raw statistics. Currently, it supports 2 
statistics, both involving entropy: LZW compressability and Ueli Maurer's 
universal statistical test. Maurer's test is a very good and comprehensive 
measure of entropy, but requires a large amount of data. The LZW statistic 
requires much less data.""

"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/2219079.stmUS soldiers on peacekeeping duties in the future could find that a portable
translation device will be an essential part of their equipment. 
Scientists at Carnegie Mellon University have developed a prototype of a
speech translator that was road-tested by US Army chaplains in Croatia. ""This project shows how a relatively simple speech-to-speech translation
system can be rapidly and successfully constructed using today's tools,""
said the team from Carnegie Mellon University in a research paper published
recently. The research was commissioned by the US Army, which is increasingly finding
itself in peace-keeping roles where communication is key. Speaking in tongues ""In the Balkans, the Army is not just supposed to conquer somebody,"" Robert
Frederking of Carnegie Mellon University told the BBC programme Go Digital.  
Translators could be essential for US soldiers
 
""In a peacekeeping situation, you have two guys trying to beat each other up
and you are holding them apart. ""You can't just shot one of them, you have to figure what is going on and
talk to them,"" he said. The portable translator was developed with a year, using commercially
available laptops. The Army did not want to field-test the device in a battlefield situation.
So instead the translator was tested by US Army chaplains in Croatia. ""The chaplains very often end up having to talk to foreign nationals and
typically don't have any translation support,"" explained Mr Frederking. Slow system For the trials, the chaplains used the translator to speak to Croatians who
knew just a smattering of English. The system works by having a speech recogniser that picks up the words in
Croatian, turns the speech into text. The written words are then translated
into English and read out by a speech synthesizer. ""It went reasonably well half the time,"" said Mr Frederking, though it was
slow in translating phrases. The research team admit that the system is not ready to be deployed in the
field. But they say their trials showed that a portable translator could be made to
work with further research and development. The Audio Voice Translation Guide System project was a joint venture between
the US Army, the military manufacturer Lockheed Martin and Carnegie Mellon
University.

Stop Those Presses! Blonds, It Seems, Will Survive After AllOctober 2, 2002
By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN 
 Apparently it fell into the category ""too good to check.""
Last Friday, several British newspapers reported that the
World Health Organization had found in a study that blonds
would become extinct within 200 years, because blondness
was caused by a recessive gene that was dying out. The
reports were repeated on Friday by anchors for the ABC News
program ""Good Morning America,"" and on Saturday by CNN. There was only one problem, the health organization said in
a statement yesterday that it never reported that blonds
would become extinct, and it had never done a study on the
subject. ""W.H.O. has no knowledge of how these news reports
originated,"" said the organization, an agency of the United
Nations based in Geneva, ""but would like to stress that we
have no opinion of the future existence of blonds."" All the news reports, in Britain and the United States,
cited a study from the World Health Organization - ""a
blonde-shell study,"" as The Daily Star of London put it.
But none reported any scientific details from the study or
the names of the scientists who conducted it. On ""Good Morning America,"" Charles Gibson began a
conversation with his co-anchor, Diane Sawyer, by saying:
""There's a study from the World Health Organization, this
is for real, that blonds are an endangered species. Women
and men with blond hair, eyebrows and blue eyes, natural
blonds, they say will vanish from the face of the earth
within 200 years, because it is not as strong a gene as
brunets."" Ms. Sawyer said she was ""somewhat of a natural blonde.""
Jeffrey Schneider, a spokesman for ABC News, said the
anchors got the information from an ABC producer in London
who said he had read it in a British newspaper. In London, The Sun and The Express both reported that
unnamed scientists said blonds would survive longest in
Scandinavia, where they are most concentrated, and expected
the last true blond to hail from Finland. The British accounts were replete with the views of
bleached blonds who said hairdressers would never allow
blondness to become extinct, and doctors who said that rare
genes would pop up to keep natural blonds from becoming an
endangered species. Journalists in London said last night that the source of
the reports was probably one of several European news
agencies that are used by the British press, but it
remained unclear which one. Tim Hall, a night news editor at The Daily Mail, said the
report was probably distributed by The Press Association,
Britain's domestic news agency. ""Several papers picked it
up,"" he said. But Charlotte Gapper, night editor at The Press
Association, said that although it had considered running
the report on Sept. 27, it had decided not to after talking
to the World Health Organization. ""We didn't do that story because we made an inquiry to the
World Health Organization first,"" she said. ""They told us
that report was two years old, and had been covered at the
time. They said it had been picked up again that day by a
German news agency."" She added that she did not know which agency the
organization was referring to. Dr. Ray White, a geneticist at the University of California
at San Francisco, said that the disappearance of a gene for
blond hair ""sounds patently incorrect.""http://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/02/health/02BLON.html?ex=1034599071&ei=1&en=3a0e4f0b2b251593HOW TO ADVERTISE

started playing with this - I'd collected spam for a week or two, 
then mixed it up with randomly selected messages from my mail boxes.course, it instantly picked up on 'received:2001' as a non-ham. Curse that too-smart-for-me software. Still, it's probably a good
thing to note in the documentation about the software - when collecting
spam/ham, make _sure_ you try and collect from the same source.

"a cry for help dear friend , greetings to you and your family ! this mail might come to you as a surprise and the temptation to ignore it as unserious could come into your mind ; but please consider it a divine wish and accept it with a deep sense of humility . my name is jose a . martinez . i am a 64 years old man , i am cuban currently residing in dubai ( united arab emirate ) . i was formerly living in cuba and served under castro ` s government but had to run into self exile after the ruling government of fidel castro closed in on my family on accusations of anti - government statements , i was once married with two children but my family could not escape before the deadly hands of castro ` s goons fell on them . l did made a lot of money serving castro and on getting to uae , i have been a merchant here in dubai dealing in ornamentals , oriental carpets and artifacts and life was very smooth for me until about three ( 3 ) years ago when i was first diagnosed of cancer of the larynx . before this happened my business and concern for making money was all i lived for , i never really cared about other values in life . but since the loss of my family and hometown , i have found a new desire to assist helpless families . i have been helping orphans in orphanage / motherless homes . i have once donated some money to orphans in war ravaged eritrea , somalia , sudan and some east european countries . before i became ill , i kept $ 4 . 5 million in a long - term deposit vault of a security / finance company and i didn ` t state any next of kin when the money was deposited and if i died without stating any the money will automatically go into the coffers of the security company and i don ` t want this to happen . i have left the hospital and presently receiving treatment in an acupuncture clinic , i have been undergoing treatment for oesophageal cancer at the hospital . i have since lost my ability to talk and my doctors have told me that i have only a few months to live . it is my last wish to see this money distributed to charity organizations . because relatives and friends have plundered so much of my wealth since my illness , i cannot live with the agony of entrusting this huge responsibility to any of them . please , i beg you in the name of god to help me collect the deposit and distribute it amongst charity organizations . use your judgement to distribute the money and feel free to reimburse yourself when you have the money for any cost you incur during the process of collecting and distributing the money to charity organizations . i am going to send you vital documents to back my claims and i am willing to offer you a reward if you are willing to help , please reply as soon as you can on my alternate email address : ( josemartinez @ starmail . com ) . looking forward to hearing from you soonest . regards , j . a martinez get tiscali broadband from £ 15 : 99",Phishing Email
"queries in a reference i can no longer identify , i recall coming across an assertion that the accent with which east indians speak english arose as a result of the teachers of english in india during the major period of british colonialism there were from wales . as a result , indians were originally taught english with a welsh accent , a happenstance of linguistic accidnet perpetuated through succeeding generations . is ther any truth to this ? does anyone out there know the origins of this ? further - - are there any studies on characteristics of national accents in foreign tongues ( eg . is there a relationship between the characteristic accent with which italians speak english and , say , the way in which they might speak russian ; or the english person 's accent in speaking spanish or in speaking french , for instance ) . finally - - a medico-linguistic query . in older medical text - books which listening to the chest with a stethoscope , the physician is instructed to tell the patient to enunciate "" ninety-nine . "" this actually makes very little sense . the origin apparently is from an early translation from the german in which the german term-equivalent used in the original text for what was translated as "" ninety-nine "" does involve strong expirations and so is a useful tool in examination . again - - does anyone out there have any info on this ? to complicate things further - - i am a biologist and not a linguist and am not on this list ! so i would greatly apprciate it you could communicate with me directly : shodell @ aurora . liunet . edu very many thanks for reading this far and for any help you might be able to offer - - mike shodell",Safe Email

have even more to appreciate.2. Write out my three most important goals and visualize 
how my life will be when I have achieved them. FEEL it. 
EXPERIENCE it in as much sensory detail as I can possibly 
imagine.3. Take some action steps toward each of the three goals.4. Exercise my body and monitor carefully what I eat and 
drink. Reduce fat and caloric intake while expending more 
calories. Eat only small amounts at one time.5. Read something educational, inspirational or
entertaining--preferably all three.6. Meditate. Empty my conscious mind and listen to the

no    19%Comments:
~~~~~~~~~No. This is a funny thing to me.  I hear about so many 
people being super scared to give out their SS#.  Well folks, 
I can get your SS# for 50 cents.  Give me a name and address 
and about 90% of the time I can get the number.  We are so worried about putting our credit card number on
the net, but we will give the card to a waiter or waitress and 
they take it out of our sight for 10 minutes.  They could do 
who knows what with the CC number.  I once had a person 
tell me that her lawyer said that she should never fax a copy 
of her check to anyone (checks by fax) because then that 
person (me) would have her account info and could write 
a check out for thousands of dollars.  I told her to just send 
it to me then and she said that was OK.  Then I asked her 
to tell me what the difference was between the original check 
and a fax copy.  I told her to ask her lawyer that too.  Never 
heard back from her.  The bottom line is that if a crook wants to get your info, it is 
available in many places.  Have a good day.
--  Terry    http://mysiteinc.com/tfn/lfi.html
~~~~~~~~~Yes. I believe that the risk is out there but minimal. However, 
we can cut those risks by a few simple precautions. Most 
importantly, never give any personal information at a site 
that is not secure, always look for the lock in thetask bar 
or a Veri secure sign or others. Also, never leave your information stored at a site. I put 
in my credit information in each time instead of having 
an account in standing, a little more time but less risks 
involved! Of course, I mostly shop at my own Internet 
mall and I know how safe it is there, credit card info is 
deleted in a matter of seconds. Overall, I believe the web 
to be a safe and very fruitful new frontier!
--  Catherine F.      http://www.catco.nexgenmall.com 
~~~~~~~~~Yes. I had phenomena for 6 weeks and did not realize that 
my ISP was shut down at the same time because the owner 
was in a bad car accident.  I had a full service account.  
My Internic fees were not paid so my WEB Address 
went unprotected.  A Russian stepped in; paid the fees; 
and, promptly assigned my www.SchoolOfGeomatics.com 
address to a porn shop.  Thus, I lost 4 years of building 
up 1st place rankings on 12 Search Engines and 2nd place 
on 8 more.  This set me back about 4  months: I believe I 
lost a minimum of $50,000.  
 
I have also been hit with viruses about 10 times.  The first 
time I lost almost 4 months of work.  Now, I back up often 
enough to not to lose so much time.  This is also Internet 
theft.  These people are nothing but out and out criminals 
and should spend years behind bars.
 
Customers are well protected from credit card theft; 
however, merchants can lose a lot of money.  I sell only by 
purchase order and certified or registered company checks.

on 8 more.Â  This set me back about 4Â  months: I believe I
lost a minimum of $50,000.
Â 
I have also been hit with viruses about 10 times.Â  The first
time I lost almost 4 months of work.Â  Now, I back up often
enough to not to lose so much time.Â  This is also Internet
theft.Â  These people are nothing but out and out criminals
and should spend years behind bars.
Â 
Customers are well protected from credit card theft;
however, merchants can lose a lot of money.Â  I sell only by
purchase order and certified or registered company checks.

"This is due to insufficient write privileges to the ""razor-agent.log"" 
file. A quick work-around is to do a ""chmod go+rx"" on that file (of 
course, it's better to restrict the access as much as possible).In Agent.pm, when the Razor2::Logger object is created, if it doesn't 
have write permission to the log file it does not succeed. Then, later 
in the code when the log object is used, it fails with the ""unblessed"" 
error.Hope this helps,

There are many more whoe only have one partner over ""long""
periods of time. So it is far from ""vacuous"" to describe some
people as ""promiscuous"" and others as ""not promiscuous"", 
especially over a set period. (""He was promiscuous in college.
He is no longer promiscuous."")The word has a clear meaning, despite your continuing tendency 
to gloss that meaning over with population averages. > >Consider a population of 3 males and 3 females.

pair off with 500,000 women. Then, 1 man, let's call him ""Wilt"",
also has sex with the other 499,999 women. 499,999 women have had more than one partner. 499,999 men have
only had one partner. It is now ""perfectly obvious"" that in the
common meaning of the term, among this contrived population, 
that women are ""more promiscuous"" than men -- even though the
single ""most promiscuous"" person, Wilt, is a man.  ""Promiscuity"" is not ""exactly, perfectly identical between males 
and females"", except under a degenerate custom definition of
""promiscuity"".> >unless ""promiscuity"" is defined uselessly.

> Ain't nothin' useless about averages.Averages are useful, sure -- but much more so if called by their 
actual name, rather than conflated with another concept.- Gordon",Safe Email

I'm not sure it's loading it. For a start, the / filesystem is being
mounted as ext2, at first, not ext3. It does seem mounted as ext3 after
the fsck is done - but that means that it's mounted as ext2 read only,
fsck'ed and then remounted ext3. Losing the point of it. Given I can't pass the kernel parameters (I think), how then can I get it
to load the initrd ?Kate

This is remarkable for its lack of newsworthiness.1) Bletchley Park used optical sensors, which were (and still are) the best way to read paper tape at high speed.

"It was the Spring of 1979.  I was just a tall, goofy looking kid in middle school
with buck-teeth and freckles.  Each day in the
cafeteria, I walked from table to table ...Stealing other kids' lunch money.No, I didn't rob them with a gun or a knife - I just made
them a little deal.  ""Let me borrow two dollars today,"" I said,
""and I'll bring you five dollars next week.""  The investment
was too good to pass up, and other kids were throwing their
lunch money at me like gravy on mashed potatoes.  Of course 
when ""next week"" rolled around and I couldn't pony up the cash,
I promised to pay them even more the week after that,
if they would just let me keep their investment a little bit 
longer.Eventually the end of the year came and went, high school
started and with it came girls, and homework, and parties,
and sports, and those poor kids from eighth grade had more 
things on their mind than last year's lunch money.I made off with a tidy sum for a middle school kid,
and I didn't even get beat up.Hidden inside this story are the two greatest stock market 
secrets you will ever learn.First of all, greed is your number one enemy. You're not
going to turn $2 into $5 in a week, so cash out when
you're ahead.  Don't wait for the boat to sink before 
grabbing the lifejacket.Second, never trust an investment adviser of any kind.
They are looking out for their own money, not yours.The ""professionals"", those stuffy investment counselors and
money managers, will always tell you that the best time to
buy is NOW.  According to those guys, the longer you keep
your money in the market, the more money you're going to make.
Ask them when is the best time to sell and their answer is
""NEVER"".  In a sense, they are right.  If you put $250,000 in an index
fund right now, you'll probably have over a million dollars
in thirty or forty years.  But here's the problem:Do you want to WAIT thirty or forty years to be rich?Hell no!You want the money NOW - so you can enjoy it. It's hard to
make use of your fortune when you're seventy years old 
in a wheelchair.  If you could make a million dollars in
the next few years, what would you do with it?  Where would
you travel?  What kind of car would you buy?  The fact is ... youth is the best time to be rich.If your goal is to make quick profits in the market, volatility
is your ally, and stability your enemy.  You want to see
those large upswings, two hundred points in a day, followed
by the four hundred point crash a week later.  You don't
care if the market went up or down 20% this year as long
it was UNSTABLE.  That's how you're going to make the 
money.What I'm talking about here is day trading.  My father invests the traditional way; he holds some good stocks 
and he goes up 30K and down 30K. In the long term of 5-10 years 
he makes money. The day trader buys or sells 5,000 shares of XYZ for a
$25,000 profit in a 5-10 minute trade.  He acts quickly, taking 
advantage of all the information at his disposal about a 
certain stock, and estimating whether it will go up or 
down within hours, sometimes within minutes.  I can teach you how to do this - and how to make amazing 
amounts of money at it.  It's not rocket science, and you 
only need to learn a few basic principles to get started.Society would have you believe that successful trading is 
complicated and requires formal training.  The truth is, wealthy people use very simple investment 
strategies to make money.  Popular media and investment professionals portray successful
trading as difficult and complex to scare you out of the boxing
ring.  They don't want the competetion - and they sure as hell
don't want you paying a few dollars to an online trading firm
to execute a trade for which they'd charge you forty or fifty 
dollars.They make their money only if you believe two lies:1) That investing is too difficult and risky for the average 
person.2) That using an investment adviser who charges a high 
commission is safer than trading online for a few bucks 
per trade.Here is what the financial gurus in today's society absolutely,
positively DO NOT WANT YOU TO KNOW ...The strategies for profitable day trading are in fact
so simple that anyone can do it - provided they spend
a few hours of studying.  After reading over 200 financial books and publications
during the past decade, and after using day trading
to successfully make more than four million dollars in
the stock market, I've learned the following lessons:** Achieving financial success is incredibly simple.** Anyone can do it.** It only takes a few hours to learn.When I discovered the secret to day trading, I didn't become
wealthy overnight.  If you want instant cash, drive to Wal-mart. 
Buy a ski mask and a shotgun, and rob your local bank. The 
only way to get rich, quick or otherwise, is through
hard work, knowledge, and determination.After learning the fundamentals of day trading, I started 
practicing the trading art itself, and the first few weeks
brought modest gains.  The next few months gave me the practical
experience I needed to really earn a living, and I was pulling
close to a six figure income. In less than three years with no 
formal financial training, minimal effort and only moderate risk,
I had made my first million.  The knowledge that I gained 
during those formative trading years I am willing to share
with you in my new book, the Master Trader.  You will learn from
my mistakes, and from my successes, as I teach you the simple,
secret formula for day trading that I've used profitably
year after year.The income of the day trader can be staggering.  Thousands, even 
hundreds of thousands of dollars can be made or lost within
minutes.  The difference between making money and losing your 
shirt is simply this: knowledge.  I will provide that knowledge,
and I will give you a winning edge at this high-stakes game. Average Income of a Day Trader: 
5% average an income in excess of $500,000 per year
22% average an income in excess of $250,000 per year
35% average an income in excess of $100,000 per year. 
27% average an income between $50,000 and $99,999 per year 
11% average an income between $20,000 and $49,999 per year After reading the Master Trader, you will discover extremely 
profitable, simple yet powerful trading methods that give 
you an almost unfair trading advantage and make you 
win DESPITE the current market weakness. Here is just a snippet of what I will teach you:*** Make money whether a stock goes up or down.
*** Learn how to get in and out of stocks within split seconds.
*** Learn exactly what stocks to trade, the exact price to 
buy them and the exact price to sell them. 
*** Save thousands of dollars by learning to avoid the 
mistakes beginners make.
*** Learn how to trade stocks like a pro and how to make money 
consistently in every market! 
*** Learn proven strategies that give you the highest chance 
for great success.

*** Make money on the biggest news stories.
*** Actively manage your risks and learn how to realize maximum
returns. 
*** Learn how to use the tools and information Wall Street 
professionals use.
*** Learn how to develop and maintain a winning state of mind. 
It's time to ask yourself: ""Am I going to listen to the 
Professionals who say BUY BUY BUY but never sell?  Or am
I going to take control of my own financial future, and
start making money RIGHT NOW in the stock market?""Who is looking out for your best economic interests - some
wealthy Wall Street stockbroker, or yourself?With the Master Trader e-book, you will learn everything you 
need to know in order to get started with Day Trading ... from 
choosing the best broker in order to take advantage of the 
lowest commissions and instant order executions to professional 
trading strategies that make professional traders millions of 
dollars.The Master Trader e-book is the most comprehensive yet easy to

 Thank you for your interest! 
 Judgment Courses offers an extensive Audio training
course in 
 ""How to Collect Money Judgments""
  .          S6 If you are like many people, you are not even sure what a
Money Judgment is and 
 why processing Money Judgments
can earn you very substantial income
  .If you ever sue a company or a person and you win then you
will have a Money Judgment against them.You are happy you won but you will soon find out the
shocking fact: ""Its now up to you to collect on the
Judgment"". The court does not require the loser to pay you.
The court will not even help you. You must trace the loser
down, find their assets, their employment, bank accounts,
real estate, stocks and bonds, etc.Very few people know how to find these assets or what to do
when they are found. The result is that millions of
Judgments are just sitting in files and being forgotten.""In 79% of the cases the winner of a Judgment never sees a
dime.""The non-payment of judicial debt has grown to epidemic
proportions. Right now in the United States there is
between 
 200 and 300 billion dollars of uncollected Money
Judgment debt
  . For every Judgment that is paid, 5 more
Judgments take its place.We identified this massive market 8 years ago and have
actively pursued Judicial Judgments since. We invented this
business. We have perfected it into a well proven and solid
profession in which only a select few will be trained in the
techniques necessary to succeed.With our first hand experience we have built a course which
teaches you how to start your business in this new unknown
and exciting field of processing Money Judgments.By following the steps laid out in our course and with
reasonable effort you can become very successful in the
processing of Money Judgments.The income potential is substantial in this profession. 
 We
have associates who have taken our course and are now
working full time making $96,000.00 to over $200,000.00 per
year. Part time associates are earning between $24,000.00
and $100,000.00 per year 
 . Some choose to operate out of
their home and work by themselves. Others build a sizable
organization of 15 to 25 people in attractive business
offices.Today our company and our associates have over 126
million dollars in Money Judgments that we are currently
processing. Of this 126 million, 25 million is in the form
of joint ventures between our firm and our associates.
Joint ventures are where we make our money. We only break
even when our course is purchased. We make a 12% margin on
the reports we supply to our associates. Our reporting
capability is so extensive that government agencies, police
officers, attorneys, credit agencies etc., all come to us
for reports.
Many of our associates already have real estate liens in
force of between 5 million to over 15 million dollars.
Legally this means that when the properties are sold or
refinanced our associate must be paid off. The norm is 10%
interest compounded annually on unpaid Money Judgments.
Annual interest on 5 million at 10% translates to
$500,000.00 annually in interest income, not counting the
payment of the principal.Our associates earn half of this amount or $250,000.00 per
year. This is just for interest, not counting principle
and not counting the compounding of the interest which can
add substantial additional income. Typically companies are
sold for 10 times earnings. Just based on simple interest
an associate with 5 million in real estate liens could sell
their business for approximately 2.5 million dollars.
 92% of all of our associates work out of their home; 43%
are women and 36% are part time
  .One of the benefits of working in this field is that you are
not under any kind of time frame. If you decide to take off
for a month on vacation then go. The Judgments you are
working on will be there when you return. The Judgments
are still in force, they do not disappear.The way we train you is non-confrontational. You use your
computer and telephone to do most of the processing. You
never confront the debtor. The debtor doesn't know who you
are. You are not a collection agency.Simply stated the steps to successful Money Processing
are as follows:Mail our recommended letter to companies and individuals
with Money Judgments. (We train you how to find out who
to write to)8% to 11% of the firms and people you write will call you
and ask for your help. They call you, you don't call them
unless you want to.You send them an agreement (supplied in the course) to
sign which splits every dollar you collect 50% to you and
50% to them. This applies no matter if the judgment is for
$2,000.00 or $2,000,000.00.You then go on-line to our computers to find the debtor
and their assets. We offer over 120 powerful reports to
assist you. They range from credit reports from all three
credit bureaus, to bank account locates, employment
locates, skip traces and locating stocks and bonds, etc.
The prices of our reports are very low. Typically 1/2 to
1/3 of what other firms charge. For example we charge
$6.00 for an individuals credit report when some other
companies charge $25.00.Once you find the debtor and their assets you file
garnishments and liens on the assets you have located.
(Standard fill in the blanks forms are included in the
course)When you receive the assets you keep 50% and send 50% to
the original Judgment holder.Once the Judgment is fully paid you mail a Satisfaction of
Judgment to the court. (Included in the course)Quote's from several of our students:Thomas in area code 516 writes us: ""I just wanted to drop
you a short note thanking you for your excellent course. 
 My
first week, part time, will net me 3,700.00 dollars
  . Your
professionalism in both the manual and the video opened
doors for me in the future. There's no stopping me now.
Recently Thomas states he has over $8,500,000 worth of
judgments he is working on.After only having this course for four months, Larry S. in
area code 314 stated to us: "" 
 I am now making $2,000.00 per
week 
 and expect this to grow to twice this amount within the
next year. I am having a ball. I have over $250,000 in
judgments I am collecting on now.""After having our course for 7 months Larry S. in 314 stated
"" 
 I am now making $12,000.00
  per month and have approximately
$500,000.00 in judgments I am collecting on. Looks like I
will have to hire someone to help out""Marshal in area code 407 states to us ""I feel bad, you only
charged me $259.00 for this course and it is a goldmine. I
have added 3 full time people to help me after only having
your course for 5 months"">From the above information and actual results you can see
why we can state the following:With our course you can own your own successful business.
A business which earns you substantial income now and one
which could be sold in 3-5 years, paying you enough to
retire on and travel the world. A business which is
extremely interesting to be in. A Business in which every
day is new and exciting.None of your days will be hum-drum. Your brain is
Challenged. A business, which protects you from Corporate
Downsizing. A business which you can start part time from
your home and later, if you so desire, you can work in full
time. A business, which is your ticket to freedom from
others telling you what to do. A business, which lets you
control your own destiny. Our training has made this happen
for many others already. Make it happen for you!If the above sounds interesting to you then its time for you
to talk to a real live human being, no cost or obligation
on your part.
 Please call us at 1_406_652_0194 
 .We have 
 Customer Support staff available to you from 8:00am to
9:00pm (Mountain Time) 7 days a week
  . If you call this number
you can talk to one of our experienced Customer Support personnel.
They can answer any questions you may have - with no obligation.
Sometimes we run special pricing on our courses and combinations
of courses. When you call our Customer Support line they can let
you know of any specials we may be running. If you like what you
read and hear about our courses, then the Customer Support person
can work with you to place your order. We are very low key. We
merely give you the facts and you can then decide if you want to
work with us or not.Thank you for your time and interest.

"Well, I tried the Ximian GNOME 2.0 packages from
http://apt.sunnmore.net, and have to say, it was a let-down.  Ran
'apt-get update' , 'apt-get install gnome-session' then 'apt-get
upgrade' and Nautilus failed to execute, couldn't get any help docs to
come up, along with more problems.  So, with the luck of 'rpm -qa|grep
ximian' then removing by hand all ximian packages with 'rpm -e --nodeps'
and reinstalling everything GNOME and GNOME-related with apt, I got
trusty old Red Hat 7.3 GNOME back on the desktop, and the only trace of
Ximian is Evolution, again, thanks to apt from this site.I really liked Ximian (back then, Helix ?) at first but, to me, Red
Hat's GNOME, released with 7.3 seems much more pretty and up-to-date. 
Could this be because of inclusion of gtk2 in RH 7.3?Lance  On Fri, 2002-07-26 at 07:40, MichÃ¨l Alexandre Salim wrote:

"summary : ' typewriter ' and "" canadian "" raising i recently asked , as i do periodically , if anyone knows of speakers who have different vowels in _ rider _ and _ writer _ ( i . e . , who have canadian raising , so called , for the diphthong / ai / ) but who use the vowel of _ rider _ in the second syllable of _ typewriter _ . i received a fair amount of mostly irate comments from people who thought this was impossible . however , i have found one speaker ( who happens to be a linguist but not a phonologist ) who has this pronunciation . as it happens he is not from ontario , but from illinois , but i believe that his existence strengthens the case for the hitherto purely hypothetical account i have proposed of how joos came to "" invent "" the non-existent ontario dialect in which supposedly _ writer _ and _ rider _ were homophonous . a careful reading of joos shows that the only example he actually cites is _ typewriter _ , not _ writer _ ! i thus believe that there must have been more speakers who said _ writer _ with a higher vowel , but both _ rider _ and _ typewriter _ with a lower one than my sole informant , and that this sporadic pronunciation is what led to the birth of the whole myth about rule ordering in canadian english , which persists till now as the example of crucial rule ordering in the phonological literature . it may not be as glamorous as the eskimo snow word myth , but there it is .",Safe Email

"sum : quantification about four weeks ago , in linguist 8 . 948 , i asked a question on behalf of the basque language academy 's grammar commission about the standard or recommended scope of "" quantifier "" and "" quantification "" as grammatical terms , with special reference to the function of "" so many "" and "" so "" in sentences like : there were so many students that we needed a larger classroom . the students were so intelligent that we needed to get another teacher . i wished to know whether it is considered terminologically appropriate to say that not only "" many "" and "" so many "" but also "" very "" and "" so "" quantify , and thus that the function of all of these ( including what i call degree modifiers ) is quantification . better to contextualize the terminological problem that motivated the question in the first place and to help clarify the following report / discussion , let me suggest , ad hoc , calling the two positions contemplated the "" quantifiers versus degree modifiers "" position and the "" quantifiers subsuming degree modifiers "" position respectively ; or for short , the versus position and the subsuming position . it is also only honest for me to declare at this point that my personal position has always been and continues to be that of the versus view , although i tried to word the original question neutrally . at this point i perhaps ought to note that several respondents seem to prefer to treat "" so many ( students ) "" and "" so ( intelligent ) "" as merely various occurrences of a single item "" so "" rather than treating _ so many _ as an "" item "" to be discussed in its own right . i view this as a manifestation of linguistic anglocentrism : unlike english , in many languages "" so many "" is not expressed by the item equivalent to english "" so "" plus a quantifier equivalent to english "" many "" , and since i was not particularly asking about english in my question , i reject the assumption that the english lexical composition of "" so many "" is of crucial relevance to the issue i raised . thanks to the following who responded to my question : bruce d . despain , patricia galea , e . h . klein - v . d . laaken , jan k . lindstrom , p . l . peterson and marilyn n . silva . a summary of their answers and suggestions follows , with an interjection of my own personal opinion at times , identified by my initials ark . marilyn silva supports the versus position , stating that "" quantifiers determine noun phrases , not adjectives . "" for "" very "" and "" so "" she prefers the term "" intensifier "" to my proposed "" degree modifier "" . patricia galea expresses the same views . ( [ ark : ] since my original question was not about the latter terms , i shall refrain from defending my preference of "" degree modifier "" over "" intensifier "" in this context ; larry trask 's _ dictionary of grammatical terms in linguistics _ treats the two terms as interchangeble . ) marilyn silva also discussed what i called "" consecutive "" sentences , pointing out that the subordinate clauses in the two english examples cited above , "" . . . that we needed a larger classroom "" and "" . . . that we needed to get another teacher "" , are called "" adverbial clauses of extent "" in her treatment of english grammar , _ grammar in many voices _ ( ntc pub . group , 1995 ) . she considers that here "" it is the clause that seems to quantify , not the intensifier in the main clause "" . silva went on to point out that english clauses of extent can be licensed by a main clause containing _ so _ ( with or without _ many _ ) , as above , but also by one containing _ such _ , as in : george was such a gentleman that he never raised his voice . and draws our attention to the fact that _ such _ could hardly be called a quantifier . ( [ ark : ] this argument seems to be of general typological interest , independently of the fact that there is no real equivalent of this use of _ such _ in basque . ) in all these sentences with extent clauses , silva argues , "" it is the [ subordinate ] clause that seems to quantify , not the intensifier in the main clause . . . which merely licenses the subordinate clause . "" according to silva , then , _ so _ and _ such _ should not be lumped together with items like _ many _ or _ very _ in any case , in line with the view that they do not themselves quantify but merely license a subordinate clause which quantifies . looking beyond english , jan lindstrom pointed out that in swedish a single lexical item , _ mycket _ , functions both as a quantifier ( of nouns ) meaning "" much "" and as a degree modifier or intensifier of adjectives meaning "" very "" , providing the following examples : 1 ) da "" r fanns mycket folk . ' there was much people ' 2 ) hon a "" r mycket intelligent . ' she is very intelligent ' lindstrom does not seem to be defending a particular terminological usage in providing this observation , but merely wishes to offer useful information that may be of interest in the discussion . [ ark : ] it seems to me that while the interest of this sort of observation is undeniable , it does not obviate the need for a terminological distinction , nor does it justify the subsumes position , but rather illustrates the need for linguists to employ a clear meta-language to enable us to distinguish between items or uses even where , as here , their formal expressions overlap language-specifically . ( by the way , some other instances of the use of a single form for "" very "" and "" much "" include portuguese _ muito _ , catalan _ molt _ , and italian _ molto _ ; but i can think of many more languages that do not show this kind of overlap or homonymy . ) philip peterson wrote discussing in somewhat more abstract terms the actual semantics of terms like "" many "" and "" more "" , and referred me to his article "" complexly fractionated syllogistic quantifiers "" ( journal of philosophical logic , 1991 , 20 , 287-313 ) . bruce despain 's comments are oriented to language-specific issues of syntactic classification of quantifiers in english that are not likely to be relevant to a description of basque , for which reason i shall not report his suggestions here . henny klein brought to my attention the following bibliographical reference : gary , e . ( 1979 ) extent in english . a unified account of degree and quantity . phd thesis , university of california , los angeles . in summary , none of those who responded favoured the subsuming position according to which "" very "" and "" so "" can be referred to as quantifiers or their function as quantification ( unless that was what jan lindstrom wished to imply ; it is my understanding that it was not ) . four of the six answers do not actually lean one way or the other . the two answers that address my question directly and suggest an answer , those of silva and galea , both constitute votes for the versus position . eskerrik asko denoi ( many thanks to all ) alan r . king , ph . d . alanking @ bigfoot . com alternative email addresses : mccay @ redestb . es , a @ eirelink . com , 70244 . 1674 @ compuserve . com snail : orkolaga plaza 3 1a , 20800 zarautz , basque country , spain phone : + 34-43 - 134125 / fax : + 34-43 - 130396 visit my web page at - - > http : / / www . eirelink . com / alanking /",Safe Email

Selling Travel in Today's EconomyGood morning!
  Â 
Since it may have been awhile since you visited us
atÂ www.mailpound.comÂ I
  wanted to update you on what is happening. When we launched the MailPound
  almost two years ago, our focus was on saving ""Time, Toner and
  Trees""Â by providing an alternative forÂ organizing the huge
  number of faxes suppliers sent travel agents each week. Our most popular
  feature was the FAM section, followed by the Weekly Sweepstakes.
  Â 
But that has changed.
  Â 
Like many involved in selling retail travel, we have been
  striving to find ways to succeed in a challenging environment. Additional
  commission cuts, the aftermath of 9/11, and the drop in the stock
market, has
  had a cumulative effect on all of us. To survive, to succeed, we know
that we
  will need to work harder, work smarter, and work together. We have
gotten a
  tremendous amount of support from travel agents and this has translated
into
  the ability to get more support for travel agents from suppliers.
  Â 
Our focus has expanded from providing a resource for
searching supplier
  Special Offers to providing a suite of tools and services that can create
  sales and raise commissions. Almost all of these services are supplier
  supported and FREE to travel agents.
Actively seek out the bestÂ e-commerce
values
HelpÂ you market Special Offers to your
clients
Host personal web sites for travel agents with
MailPound
    content*
OfferÂ higher commissions through
consolidation
Organize sales incentives from suppliers
Provide new technology for fast and easyÂ online

My typical Java-to-C conversion doesn't increase the lines of code by
more than 20%, and a fair portion of that is the implementation of
additional features that drove us to do the conversion in the first
place.  Some things are substantially more succinct when written in C
than in Java.  C and most other mature languages have an endless
collection of libraries.  I personally don't use anything beyond the
core libraries of any language that much though.On a tangent, I find libraries nearly useless for a great many things
due primarily to the fact that most of them are so general that a given
non-trivial API almost always has a context in which it will function in
a pathological manner.  Code reuse is wonderful and all that, but
libraries frequently make design trade-offs that won't work for me even
if they theoretically do exactly what I need.  Unfortunately, it isn't
particularly easy nor does it make a nice simple API to design a library
that really is optimizable to a wide range of design cases.  I've built
a small collection of flexible psuedo-polymorphic APIs over the years
that I tend to use, but it is a pretty ugly solution for code reuse when
you get right down to it.

I haven't been by their website in quite some time, so when 
Hal Goldstein informed me of a new electronic delivery 
method that they've employed, I felt obligated to give it a 
spin. You can check out the September 2002 Issue of the Digital

format better than the print variety. A Software and 
Accessories Encyclopedia is also new to the site since my 
last belated visit.I've also been using my PocketPC quite a bit lately, but 
not for data. It's found a more frequent home on my belt as 
an MP3 player ever since Diana's dad gave us a bicycle. 
Going out for a morning ride has been quite pleasurable, and 
it's nice to bring along some tunes. I've tried both the 
Compaq iPaq 3870 and HP Jornada 565, and have been more 
pleased with the audio ability of the iPaq, due in part to 
the sound utility Compaq provides to adjust treble and bass 
levels. It's just a more full-sounding device, in my 
opinion. See You in August,Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Randy NielandÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â GnomeNETWORK
LDAP Whodunit
Pondered by Warren Dugas""Randy, a little question for you: Do you know what LDAP is and how important it is to the world of technology? I'm sure you do - but where did it come from? Hmm, let's put our thinking caps on and try to figure it out. Did Microsoft create it? Hmm - No, how about Novell? Nope. Well, who then?""History of LDAP http://www.microsoft.com/TechNet/prodtechnol/winntas/evaluate/featfunc/ldapcmr.asp
X.500, the OSI directory standard, defines a 
comprehensive Directory Service, including an information 
model, namespace, functional model, and authentication 
framework. X.500 also defines the Directory Access Protocol 
(DAP) used by clients to access the directory. DAP is a full 
OSI protocol that contains extensive functionality, much of 
which is not used by most applications. DAP is significantly more complicated than the more 
prevalent TCP/IP stack implementations and requires more 
code and computing horsepower to run. The size and 
complexity of DAP makes it difficult to run on thin clients, 
such as the PC and Macintosh where TCP/IP functionality 
often comes with the machine. DAP stack implementations are 
cumbersome to administer, thus limiting the acceptance of 
X.500. Hence in 1993, the folks at University of Michigan, 
with help from the ISODE Consortium, designed and developed 
a protocol that would work over TCP/IP and was small enough 
when implemented to run on a thin client like PC's running 
the Windowsï¿½ operating system or the Macintosh. The LDAP version 1 Specification was published in March 
of 1994. The LDAP version 2 Specification was published as 
rfc 1777 by the Access Searching and Indexing of Directories 
(ASID) working group in the IETF in March of 1995. In April 
of 1996, 40 companies including Microsoft, Netscape, and 
Novell separately announced support for LDAP protocol in 
their Directory Services products in order that they may in 
turn operate with each other and integrate with the 
Internet. LDAP version 3.0 has gone through several drafts 
but at this time is not finished.

Looking for Sound
Suggested by Corey Holletthttp://www.turtlebeach.com/site/products/santacruz/whatdoineed.asp
http://www.3dsoundsurge.com/reviews/earlyimpressions/ProMedia51.html
""I've just gone on an extensive hunt for the best 
sound card and speaker set combination for 5.1 sound. My 
criteria were that it be excellent for games, music, and dvd 
playback. A price under $500.00 was also a strong 
point.""
Corey came to the same conclusion that others have in two 
respects. Creative has long maintained a healthy share of 
the sound card market with a solid name and decent products. 
Audiophiles know of other brands as well, such as Turtle 
Beach and Philips, which also produce quality sound cards 
and at attractive price points. Corey decided on the Turtle 
Beach Santa Cruz card, a great choice. His choice of speaker systems reinforced my own feelings 
on the subject. I own two Klipsch speaker sets, the ProMedia 
2.400 and most recently the ProMedia 5.1. The 2.400 system 
was the subject of many positive reviews, and believe me 
when I say that the ProMedia 5.1 leaves the 2.400 in the 
dust. The above review that Corey pointed out hits the high 
points, and is actually quite in-depth for an ""initial"" 
review. I'm itching to see if they eventually do write up a 
more complete version, as mentioned in the article.

QuickTime 6 Released
http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/
With the debut of QuickTime 6, we can assume that the 
licensing haggles over MPEG-4 have been resolved, making way 
for the long-awaited release. MPEG-4 isn't the only 
addition, joining a new AAC audio codec that is a favorite 
among professionals. Streaming media skip protection, Flash 
5 support and better AppleScript functionality also tag 
along. As always, there is a standard free version available 
for download, but the Pro edition adds additional features, 
such as full screen video playback, the ability to create 
MPEG-4 content and editing features not present in the free 
player.

Microtel & WalMart Love Linux
http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/4/26192.html
WalMart is selling Microtel PCs, but with a slight twist. 
They were one of the first manufacturers to preinstall 
LindowsOS and offer systems to the retail market through 
WalMart.com, and now Mandrake is being offered as a pre-
installed choice in operating systems. These options give 
potential Linux users an easier way to get started without 
having to build their own system from scratch or deal with 
driver issues, while still maintaining a low overall cost. A 
Pentium 4 2GHz system with a CD-RW drive goes for as little 
as $648 with Mandrake Linux, so not too shabby at all.

32 Easy Ways To Breath New Life Into Any Webpage
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=Â Â Â Â Â  It's true.
Ask the CEOs of Yahoo.com and America Online.Â  They'll
tell you it's true.Â  Send an email to Terry Dean or Allen
Says or Jim Daniels and ask them about it.Â  They'll agree
100% that it's true.Â  Don't just take my word for it.
In fact, you can contact any of the 10,000 folks online
selling web marketing resources, and they will all tell you
emphatically, without question, no doubts whatsoever, that
it is absolutely true.
It's true. ANYONE can earn a living online.Â  Really, they
can.Â  But, it takes several very important components to
join the 5% who are successful on the web.
Â Â Â Â  One of those necessities is a website.
Â Â Â Â  Now, your website does one of two things...
Â Â Â Â  ...it either makes the sale, or it doesn't.
For 95% of online businesses, their websites simply do
not produce results.
And there is a very simple reason for poor performance.
Poor sales letters.
Does your website convince people to make a purchase?
If not, here are 32 easy ways to breathe new life into
your sales letter...
1) Write your sales letter with an individual in mind.
Go ahead and pick out someone, a real person to write your
sales letter to.Â  Doesn't matter if it is grandma or your
next door neighbor or your cat.Â  Write your sales letter
just like you are writing it to them personally.Â  Why?
Because when your potential customer reads, it then it will
seem personal, almost like you wrote it with them in mind.
Too often, sales letters are written as if they were going
to be read to an audience rather than one person.Â  Keep your
sales letters personal, because one person at a time is
going to read them.
2) Use an illustration to get your point across.Â  In my
sales letters I have told stories about my car stalling on
the side of the road to illustrate the idea that we must
constantly add the fuel of advertising to keep our
businesses running. I have compared the hype of easily
making millions online to the chances of me riding bareback
across Montana on a grizzly bear.Â  Leads have read of how
getting to the top of an oak tree relates to aggressively
marketing online. People love a good story that pounds home
a solid message.Â  Tell stories that illustrate a point you
are trying to make.Â  Emphasize a benefit by sharing an
account from the ""real world.""Â  It effectively creates
interest and further establishes the point.
3) Create an interest in the reader from the very first
line.Â  Your first line of the sales letter should
immediately create a desire in the reader to want to know
more.Â  Go back to the beginning of this article.Â  The first
words were, ""It's true.""Â  I can guarantee you that either
consciously or subconsciously you thought ""What's true?""
Immediately, your mind wanted to know what I was talking
about.Â  Before you even knew it you were right here, 8
paragraphs into this article.Â  Carefully craft your first
line.Â  If you can immediately get them wanting to know more,
you've got a winner.
4) Use bullets. People spend a lot of time reading bulleted
lists. In fact, they often reread them over and over. Use
bulleted lists to stress the benefits of your product or
service, to spell out exactly what is included in your offer.
Use an extra space in between each bullet to really highlight
each line and create a sense of more length to the list.
5) Launch into a bullet list immediately.Â  Shortly after
your opening line, immediately give the reader a bullet
list of benefits to absorb.Â  Hit them with your best shot.
Pull out the big guns and stress ""just a few of"" the most
important things the reader will discover.Â  By offering a
killer list early in your sales letter, you will automatically
create a desire in the reader to continue through your ad
copy.Â  After all, if they are already interested after the
first list of benefits, they will certainly be open to
finding out even more reasons why your product or service
will aid them.
6) Just let it all flow out.Â  Write down everything that
enters your mind as you are writing your sales letter. You
can edit it later.Â  If you just sit and start writing
everything you know about your product or service and how it
will benefit your customer, you will be amazed at how much
information floods your mind.Â  Write it ALL down.Â  Then read
through it - you'll be able to add a lot more detail to
many of the points.Â  Edit it after you have exhausted all
of your ideas.
7) Make your sales letter personal.Â  Make sure that the
words ""you"" and ""your"" are at least 4:1 over ""I"" and ""my.""
Your ad copy must be written about YOUR CUSTOMER not
yourself.Â  I'm not sure how the old advertising adage goes,
but it's something like this, ""I don't care a thing about
your lawn mower, I just care about my lawn.""Â  Leads aren't
interested in you or your products, they are interested in
themselves and their wants and needs.Â  When you are finished
with your sales letter and have uploaded it to a test
webpage, run a check at http://www.keywordcount.com and see
what the ratio between ""you"" and ""your"" versus references to
""I,"" ""me,"" ""my,"" etc.Â  It's a free service.Â  Make sure it's
at least 4:1 in favor of the customer.
8) Write like you speak.Â  Forget all of those rules that
your grammar teacher taught you.Â  Write your sales letters
in everyday language, just like you would talk in person.
Don't be afraid to begin sentences with ""And"" or ""Because.""
Don't worry about ending a sentence with a preposition.
Write like you speak. Your sales letter isn't the great
American novel, so don't write it like you are Ernest
Hemingway.
9) Use short paragraphs consisting of 2-4 sentences each.
Long copy works... but long paragraphs do not.Â  Use short
paragraphs that lead into the next paragraph. Don't be
afraid to use short sentences.Â  Like this one.
Or this.
See what I mean?Â  Shorter paragraphs keep the interest of
the reader. Longer paragraphs cause eye strain and often
force the reader to get distracted.
10)Â  Stress the benefits, not the features.Â  Again,
readers want the burning question answered, ""What's in it
forÂ  me?""Â  What need is it going to meet? What want is it
going to fill?Â  How is your product or service going to be
of value or benefit to the reader?Â  Spell it out.Â  Don't
focus on the features of your product or service , but
rather how those features will add value to the life of your
reader.
For example:Â  If you are selling automobile tires, you may
very well have the largest assortment of tires in the world,
but who cares? I don't care about your selection. But, I
do care about keeping my 3-month-old baby girl safe while
we are traveling.Â  So, instead of focusing on your selection,
you focus on the fact that my baby girl can be kept safe
because you have a tire that will fit my car. You're not
selling tires, you're selling safety for my family. Stress
the benefits, not the features.
11) Keep the reader interested.Â  Some sales letters read
like they are a manual trying to explain to me how I can
perform some complicated surgery on my wife. They are
filled with words and phrases that I need a dictionary to
understand.Â  Unless you are writing to a very targeted
audience, avoid using technical language that many readers
might not understand. Keep it simple, using words, language
and information that are easy to understand and follow.
12) Target your sales letter.Â  When you are finished with
your final draft of the sales letter, target it to a
specific audience.Â  For example: If you are selling a ""work
at home"" product, then rewrite the sales letter by adding
words in the headlines and ad copy that are targeted towards
women who are homemakers.Â  Then, rewrite the same sales
letter and target it to college students.Â  Write another
letter targeting senior citizens.Â  Still another could be
written to high school teachers wanting to earn extra income
during summer vacation.Â  The possibilities are endless.
All you need to do is add a few words here and there in
your ad copy to make it appear that your product or service
is specifically designed for a target audience. ""Work only
5 hours a week,"" would become ""College Students, work only
5 hours a week.""Â  Your sales letter is now targeted. Upload
all of the sales letters to separate pages on your website
(you could easily target 100's of groups).
Then, simply advertise the targeted pages in targeted
mediums.Â  You could advertise the ""College Students"" page
in a campus ezine.Â  The ""Senior Citizens"" page could be
advertised at a retirement community message board.
By creating these targeted sales letters, you can literally
open up dozens of new groups to sell your existing product
to.Â  And, in their eyes, it looks like the product was a
match made for them.
13) Make your ad copy easy to follow.Â  Use short sentences
and paragraphs. Break up the sales letter with attention
grabbing headlines that lead into the next paragraph. One
thing that I have always found to work very well in sales
letters...
Â Â Â Â  ...is to use a pause like this.
Start the sentence on one line, leaving the reader wanting
to know more, and then finishing up on the next line. Also,
if you are going to use a sales letter that continues on
several different pages of your website, use a catchy hook
line at the end of each page to keep them clicking. ""Let's
get you started down the road to success, shall we? CLICK
HERE to continue.""
14) Use similes and metaphors for effect.Â  When the
customer purchases your product, they will generate ""a flood
of traffic that would make Noah start building another ark.""
If they do not order today, then they will ""feel like a cat
that let the mouse get away.""Â  Use words to create a picture
in the readers' mind.Â  When you think of Superman, what
comes to mind?Â  Immediately, we remember that he is ""faster
than a speeding bullet.""Â  ""More powerful than a locomotive.""
""Able to leap tall buildings in a single bound."" See how
word pictures stick in our minds?
15) Focus on one product or service.Â  Don't try to sell
your customer multiple products at the same time. It only
confuses the reader.Â  Keep your ad copy directed at one
specific product or service.Â  Then, use other products and
services as back-end products.
16) Make it stand out.Â  Don't kid yourself.Â  There are
hundreds, maybe thousands out there on the web doing the
same thing you are doing.Â  How will you stand out among the
crowd?Â  Your sales letter must inject personality. It must
breathe of originality.Â  Your product or service is
different. It's not like all of the rest.Â  It is unique.
Right? Your sales letter must separate you from the
competition.Â  It must create a feeling of ""You won't find
this anywhere else.""
17) Be believable. ""Earn $54,000 in the next 24 hours!!!""
Delete.Â  Good grief, do they think I am an idiot or
something?Â  Get real.Â  Don't make outrageous claims that
are obviously not the truth.Â  You'll ruin your reputation.
Let me tell you a simple universal fact that cannot be
reversed.Â  Once you have been branded a liar, you will
NEVER be anything but a liar.Â  It doesn't matter if you
launch the most respectable, honest business available
anywhere, people will always have doubt because they
remember the crazy stuff you've said before.Â  Be believable.
Don't exaggerate, mislead, stretch or distort the truth.
18) Be specific. Don't generalize your information, but
rather be EXACT.Â  Instead of ""over 100 tips for losing
weight"" use ""124 tips for losing weight."" By generalizing
information, it creates doubt and questions in the reader's
mind.Â  ""What am I really getting here?Â  Does he even know?""
When you use specific information, the reader begins to
think, ""This person must have counted.Â  I know exactly what
I can expect.""Â  ""Platitudes and generalities roll off the
human understanding like water from a duck,"" wrote Claude
Hopkins in his classic book ""Scientific Advertising."" ""They
leave no impression whatsoever.""
19) Be complete. Tell the reader everything they would
want to know about your product or service.Â  Answer all of
their questions, anything they would want to consider before
making a purchase.Â  Think about it from their point of view.
Ask yourself, ""Why wouldn't I buy this?""Â  Then, address that
in your sales letter.Â  Remove anything that would keep the
reader from making the purchase.
20) Use testimonials to boost your sales.Â  Share actual
excerpts from what your current customers are saying about
your product or service. Many websites have an entire
section or even a separate page that has endorsements and
compliments listed.Â  Satisfied customers remove some of the
doubt in the mind of the reader.Â  ""If these people have
found a lot of value and benefit in the product, then I
probably will too.""Â  Especially effective are testimonials
from respected, well known ""authorities"" within your target
field.
21) Use headlines over and over throughout the sales letter.
A headline isn't just relegated to the beginning of your
ad copy.Â  Use them frequently -but don't overuse.Â  A well-
placed headline re-grabs the reader's attention, brings
them deeper into the letter, and readies them for the next
paragraph. You will want to spend as much time working on
your headlines as you do the entire sales letter.Â  They are
that important.
22) Avoid asking stupid questions.Â  ""Wouldn't you like to
make $1,000,000 a year?"" ""Doesn't that sound great?"" ""Would
you like to be as successful as I am?""Â  Avoid any question
that insults the intelligence of your reader or makes them
feel like they are inferior.
23) Offer a freebie even if the customer doesn't buy.
If the customer decides he or she isn't going to make a
purchase, then you want to follow-up with them later to try
to influence them to buy in the future.Â  By offering a free
item, you canÂ  request their email address in order to
obtain the freebie.Â  By doing this, you can now follow-up
with the customer for a potential future sale.
Additionally, you can continue the sales process by having
your ad copy, banners, flyers, etc. within the free item.
And, of course, if your free item is a high quality, useful
product or service which impresses the customer, they
probably will be back as a customer soon.
24) Use bonuses to overwhelm the reader.Â  One of the things
that I have found very effective in writing sales letters
is to include bonus items that OUT-VALUE the actual product
I am offering.Â  Ginsu made this one famous. They were
selling a set of steak knives, but before the commercial
was finished, you had so many bonus items on the table
it was hard to refuse. Make sure you provide quality
bonuses and not some worthless, outdated junk that damages
the credibility of your main offer.
25) Use connective phrases like ""But wait, there's more""
and ""But that's not all.""Â  These phrases effectively lead
the reader from one paragraph to the next, particularly
when the next paragraph is a bullet list of benefits, or
leads into bonus items.Â  Again, the idea is MORE and MORE
value and benefits to the reader.
26) Always include a deadline.Â  By including a deadline,
you create a sense of urgency in the mind of the customer.
""If I don't order within 24 hours, then I won't get the
bonuses.""Â  ""Oh no, there are only 10 items remaining,
I've got to hurry.""Â  Let the customer know what they will
be missing out on if they don't make the deadline. Remember,
they won't miss out on your products or bonuses, they will
miss out on all of the benefits of your products. Deadlines
are very effective.Â  Every sales letter should have one.
27) Tell them exactly how to order.Â  Be clear as to the
order process. Point them towards the order link.Â  Tell
them what methods you offer. (I.E. credit cards, checks,
etc.)Â  Make this process as simple and clear as can be.
If it takes more than 2 steps, most people won't continue.
28)Â  Explain when the product will be delivered.Â  How
quickly will the order be processed?Â  When will the order be
available?Â  Let the customer know exactly what they can
expect when they place their order.Â  The more specific you
can be here, the better.Â  Let them know that you have a
system in place.Â  ""Operators are standing by.""Â  Their order
will be handled properly.Â  Tell them.
29) Offer a money back guarantee.Â  Take away their last
reason to hold back.Â  Offer a ""no questions asked"" 30 day
guarantee.Â  Most people may not realize this, but in most
cases, it's the law of the land.Â  You are REQUIRED to give
them their money back if they are not satisfied with the
product or service.Â  Since it's the law anyway, why not make
it a benefit. Let them know that they are purchasing your
product or service RISK-FREE.
30) Instruct them to respond immediately.Â  Many people
just need to read those words, ""Act Now!""Â  ""Order today!""
""Click Here to Instantly Place Your Order.""Â  You've got them
this far, now tell them what you want them to do.Â  Get them
to ""Act Fast!""Â  Have you ever heard a mail order commercial
on television that didn't prompt the viewer to order right
way?
31) Include a post script.Â  People will always read the
P.S.Â  Always. In fact, the P.S. is one of the MOST IMPORTANT
parts of your sales letter. Why?Â  Because in many cases the
visitor at your website will scroll immediately down to the
end of your page to see how much it is going to cost.Â  A
P.S. is a perfect place to recap your offer, so when they
see your price tag, they will also see a very detailed
description of what they will receive for their money. Use
your P.S. to restate your offer in detail.
32) Include a second post script.Â  You better believe
if they read the first P.S., they will read a P.P.S.Â  Use
this post script to remind them of the deadline or offer
another bonus or point out some compelling factor that would
make them want to order.Â  I guarantee you they will read it.
Use these 32 tips and I guarantee you that you will see
a significant increase in the amount of responses you
receive from your sales letters.Â  In fact, it would be
impossible for your responses to not improve.

 32 Easy Ways To Breath New Life Into Any WebpageÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â  It's true.
Ask the CEOs of Yahoo.com and America Online.Â  They'll
tell you it's true.Â  Send an email to Terry Dean or Allen
Says or Jim Daniels and ask them about it.Â  They'll agree
100% that it's true.Â  Don't just take my word for it.
In fact, you can contact any of the 10,000 folks online
selling web marketing resources, and they will all tell you
emphatically, without question, no doubts whatsoever, that
it is absolutely true.
It's true. ANYONE can earn a living online.Â  Really, they
can.Â  But, it takes several very important components to
join the 5% who are successful on the web.
Â Â Â Â  One of those necessities is a website.
Â Â Â Â  Now, your website does one of two things...
Â Â Â Â  ...it either makes the sale, or it doesn't.
For 95% of online businesses, their websites simply do
not produce results.
And there is a very simple reason for poor performance.
Poor sales letters.
Does your website convince people to make a purchase?
If not, here are 32 easy ways to breathe new life into
your sales letter...
1) Write your sales letter with an individual in mind.
Go ahead and pick out someone, a real person to write your
sales letter to.Â  Doesn't matter if it is grandma or your
next door neighbor or your cat.Â  Write your sales letter
just like you are writing it to them personally.Â  Why?
Because when your potential customer reads, it then it will
seem personal, almost like you wrote it with them in mind.
Too often, sales letters are written as if they were going
to be read to an audience rather than one person.Â  Keep your
sales letters personal, because one person at a time is
going to read them.
2) Use an illustration to get your point across.Â  In my
sales letters I have told stories about my car stalling on
the side of the road to illustrate the idea that we must
constantly add the fuel of advertising to keep our
businesses running. I have compared the hype of easily
making millions online to the chances of me riding bareback
across Montana on a grizzly bear.Â  Leads have read of how
getting to the top of an oak tree relates to aggressively
marketing online. People love a good story that pounds home
a solid message.Â  Tell stories that illustrate a point you
are trying to make.Â  Emphasize a benefit by sharing an
account from the ""real world.""Â  It effectively creates
interest and further establishes the point.
3) Create an interest in the reader from the very first
line.Â  Your first line of the sales letter should
immediately create a desire in the reader to want to know
more.Â  Go back to the beginning of this article.Â  The first
words were, ""It's true.""Â  I can guarantee you that either
consciously or subconsciously you thought ""What's true?""
Immediately, your mind wanted to know what I was talking
about.Â  Before you even knew it you were right here, 8
paragraphs into this article.Â  Carefully craft your first
line.Â  If you can immediately get them wanting to know more,
you've got a winner.
4) Use bullets. People spend a lot of time reading bulleted
lists. In fact, they often reread them over and over. Use
bulleted lists to stress the benefits of your product or
service, to spell out exactly what is included in your offer.
Use an extra space in between each bullet to really highlight
each line and create a sense of more length to the list.
5) Launch into a bullet list immediately.Â  Shortly after
your opening line, immediately give the reader a bullet
list of benefits to absorb.Â  Hit them with your best shot.
Pull out the big guns and stress ""just a few of"" the most
important things the reader will discover.Â  By offering a
killer list early in your sales letter, you will automatically
create a desire in the reader to continue through your ad
copy.Â  After all, if they are already interested after the
first list of benefits, they will certainly be open to
finding out even more reasons why your product or service
will aid them.
6) Just let it all flow out.Â  Write down everything that
enters your mind as you are writing your sales letter. You
can edit it later.Â  If you just sit and start writing
everything you know about your product or service and how it
will benefit your customer, you will be amazed at how much
information floods your mind.Â  Write it ALL down.Â  Then read
through it - you'll be able to add a lot more detail to
many of the points.Â  Edit it after you have exhausted all
of your ideas.
7) Make your sales letter personal.Â  Make sure that the
words ""you"" and ""your"" are at least 4:1 over ""I"" and ""my.""
Your ad copy must be written about YOUR CUSTOMER not
yourself.Â  I'm not sure how the old advertising adage goes,
but it's something like this, ""I don't care a thing about
your lawn mower, I just care about my lawn.""Â  Leads aren't
interested in you or your products, they are interested in
themselves and their wants and needs.Â  When you are finished
with your sales letter and have uploaded it to a test
webpage, run a check at http://www.keywordcount.com and see
what the ratio between ""you"" and ""your"" versus references to
""I,"" ""me,"" ""my,"" etc.Â  It's a free service.Â  Make sure it's
at least 4:1 in favor of the customer.
8) Write like you speak.Â  Forget all of those rules that
your grammar teacher taught you.Â  Write your sales letters
in everyday language, just like you would talk in person.
Don't be afraid to begin sentences with ""And"" or ""Because.""
Don't worry about ending a sentence with a preposition.
Write like you speak. Your sales letter isn't the great
American novel, so don't write it like you are Ernest
Hemingway.
9) Use short paragraphs consisting of 2-4 sentences each.
Long copy works... but long paragraphs do not.Â  Use short
paragraphs that lead into the next paragraph. Don't be
afraid to use short sentences.Â  Like this one.
Or this.
See what I mean?Â  Shorter paragraphs keep the interest of
the reader. Longer paragraphs cause eye strain and often
force the reader to get distracted.
10)Â  Stress the benefits, not the features.Â  Again,
readers want the burning question answered, ""What's in it
forÂ  me?""Â  What need is it going to meet? What want is it
going to fill?Â  How is your product or service going to be
of value or benefit to the reader?Â  Spell it out.Â  Don't
focus on the features of your product or service , but
rather how those features will add value to the life of your
reader.
For example:Â  If you are selling automobile tires, you may
very well have the largest assortment of tires in the world,
but who cares? I don't care about your selection. But, I
do care about keeping my 3-month-old baby girl safe while
we are traveling.Â  So, instead of focusing on your selection,
you focus on the fact that my baby girl can be kept safe
because you have a tire that will fit my car. You're not
selling tires, you're selling safety for my family. Stress
the benefits, not the features.
11) Keep the reader interested.Â  Some sales letters read
like they are a manual trying to explain to me how I can
perform some complicated surgery on my wife. They are
filled with words and phrases that I need a dictionary to
understand.Â  Unless you are writing to a very targeted
audience, avoid using technical language that many readers
might not understand. Keep it simple, using words, language
and information that are easy to understand and follow.
12) Target your sales letter.Â  When you are finished with
your final draft of the sales letter, target it to a
specific audience.Â  For example: If you are selling a ""work
at home"" product, then rewrite the sales letter by adding
words in the headlines and ad copy that are targeted towards
women who are homemakers.Â  Then, rewrite the same sales
letter and target it to college students.Â  Write another
letter targeting senior citizens.Â  Still another could be
written to high school teachers wanting to earn extra income
during summer vacation.Â  The possibilities are endless.
All you need to do is add a few words here and there in
your ad copy to make it appear that your product or service
is specifically designed for a target audience. ""Work only
5 hours a week,"" would become ""College Students, work only
5 hours a week.""Â  Your sales letter is now targeted. Upload
all of the sales letters to separate pages on your website
(you could easily target 100's of groups).
Then, simply advertise the targeted pages in targeted
mediums.Â  You could advertise the ""College Students"" page
in a campus ezine.Â  The ""Senior Citizens"" page could be
advertised at a retirement community message board.
By creating these targeted sales letters, you can literally
open up dozens of new groups to sell your existing product
to.Â  And, in their eyes, it looks like the product was a
match made for them.
13) Make your ad copy easy to follow.Â  Use short sentences
and paragraphs. Break up the sales letter with attention
grabbing headlines that lead into the next paragraph. One
thing that I have always found to work very well in sales
letters...
Â Â Â Â  ...is to use a pause like this.
Start the sentence on one line, leaving the reader wanting
to know more, and then finishing up on the next line. Also,
if you are going to use a sales letter that continues on
several different pages of your website, use a catchy hook
line at the end of each page to keep them clicking. ""Let's
get you started down the road to success, shall we? CLICK
HERE to continue.""
14) Use similes and metaphors for effect.Â  When the
customer purchases your product, they will generate ""a flood
of traffic that would make Noah start building another ark.""
If they do not order today, then they will ""feel like a cat
that let the mouse get away.""Â  Use words to create a picture
in the readers' mind.Â  When you think of Superman, what
comes to mind?Â  Immediately, we remember that he is ""faster
than a speeding bullet.""Â  ""More powerful than a locomotive.""
""Able to leap tall buildings in a single bound."" See how
word pictures stick in our minds?
15) Focus on one product or service.Â  Don't try to sell
your customer multiple products at the same time. It only
confuses the reader.Â  Keep your ad copy directed at one
specific product or service.Â  Then, use other products and
services as back-end products.
16) Make it stand out.Â  Don't kid yourself.Â  There are
hundreds, maybe thousands out there on the web doing the
same thing you are doing.Â  How will you stand out among the
crowd?Â  Your sales letter must inject personality. It must
breathe of originality.Â  Your product or service is
different. It's not like all of the rest.Â  It is unique.
Right? Your sales letter must separate you from the
competition.Â  It must create a feeling of ""You won't find
this anywhere else.""
17) Be believable. ""Earn $54,000 in the next 24 hours!!!""
Delete.Â  Good grief, do they think I am an idiot or
something?Â  Get real.Â  Don't make outrageous claims that
are obviously not the truth.Â  You'll ruin your reputation.
Let me tell you a simple universal fact that cannot be
reversed.Â  Once you have been branded a liar, you will
NEVER be anything but a liar.Â  It doesn't matter if you
launch the most respectable, honest business available
anywhere, people will always have doubt because they
remember the crazy stuff you've said before.Â  Be believable.
Don't exaggerate, mislead, stretch or distort the truth.
18) Be specific. Don't generalize your information, but
rather be EXACT.Â  Instead of ""over 100 tips for losing
weight"" use ""124 tips for losing weight."" By generalizing
information, it creates doubt and questions in the reader's
mind.Â  ""What am I really getting here?Â  Does he even know?""
When you use specific information, the reader begins to
think, ""This person must have counted.Â  I know exactly what
I can expect.""Â  ""Platitudes and generalities roll off the
human understanding like water from a duck,"" wrote Claude
Hopkins in his classic book ""Scientific Advertising."" ""They
leave no impression whatsoever.""
19) Be complete. Tell the reader everything they would
want to know about your product or service.Â  Answer all of
their questions, anything they would want to consider before
making a purchase.Â  Think about it from their point of view.
Ask yourself, ""Why wouldn't I buy this?""Â  Then, address that
in your sales letter.Â  Remove anything that would keep the
reader from making the purchase.
20) Use testimonials to boost your sales.Â  Share actual
excerpts from what your current customers are saying about
your product or service. Many websites have an entire
section or even a separate page that has endorsements and
compliments listed.Â  Satisfied customers remove some of the
doubt in the mind of the reader.Â  ""If these people have
found a lot of value and benefit in the product, then I
probably will too.""Â  Especially effective are testimonials
from respected, well known ""authorities"" within your target
field.
21) Use headlines over and over throughout the sales letter.
A headline isn't just relegated to the beginning of your
ad copy.Â  Use them frequently -but don't overuse.Â  A well-
placed headline re-grabs the reader's attention, brings
them deeper into the letter, and readies them for the next
paragraph. You will want to spend as much time working on
your headlines as you do the entire sales letter.Â  They are
that important.
22) Avoid asking stupid questions.Â  ""Wouldn't you like to
make $1,000,000 a year?"" ""Doesn't that sound great?"" ""Would
you like to be as successful as I am?""Â  Avoid any question
that insults the intelligence of your reader or makes them
feel like they are inferior.
23) Offer a freebie even if the customer doesn't buy.
If the customer decides he or she isn't going to make a
purchase, then you want to follow-up with them later to try
to influence them to buy in the future.Â  By offering a free
item, you canÂ  request their email address in order to
obtain the freebie.Â  By doing this, you can now follow-up
with the customer for a potential future sale.
Additionally, you can continue the sales process by having
your ad copy, banners, flyers, etc. within the free item.
And, of course, if your free item is a high quality, useful
product or service which impresses the customer, they
probably will be back as a customer soon.
24) Use bonuses to overwhelm the reader.Â  One of the things
that I have found very effective in writing sales letters
is to include bonus items that OUT-VALUE the actual product
I am offering.Â  Ginsu made this one famous. They were
selling a set of steak knives, but before the commercial
was finished, you had so many bonus items on the table
it was hard to refuse. Make sure you provide quality
bonuses and not some worthless, outdated junk that damages
the credibility of your main offer.
25) Use connective phrases like ""But wait, there's more""
and ""But that's not all.""Â  These phrases effectively lead
the reader from one paragraph to the next, particularly
when the next paragraph is a bullet list of benefits, or
leads into bonus items.Â  Again, the idea is MORE and MORE
value and benefits to the reader.
26) Always include a deadline.Â  By including a deadline,
you create a sense of urgency in the mind of the customer.
""If I don't order within 24 hours, then I won't get the
bonuses.""Â  ""Oh no, there are only 10 items remaining,
I've got to hurry.""Â  Let the customer know what they will
be missing out on if they don't make the deadline. Remember,
they won't miss out on your products or bonuses, they will
miss out on all of the benefits of your products. Deadlines
are very effective.Â  Every sales letter should have one.
27) Tell them exactly how to order.Â  Be clear as to the
order process. Point them towards the order link.Â  Tell
them what methods you offer. (I.E. credit cards, checks,
etc.)Â  Make this process as simple and clear as can be.
If it takes more than 2 steps, most people won't continue.
28)Â  Explain when the product will be delivered.Â  How
quickly will the order be processed?Â  When will the order be
available?Â  Let the customer know exactly what they can
expect when they place their order.Â  The more specific you
can be here, the better.Â  Let them know that you have a
system in place.Â  ""Operators are standing by.""Â  Their order
will be handled properly.Â  Tell them.
29) Offer a money back guarantee.Â  Take away their last
reason to hold back.Â  Offer a ""no questions asked"" 30 day
guarantee.Â  Most people may not realize this, but in most
cases, it's the law of the land.Â  You are REQUIRED to give
them their money back if they are not satisfied with the
product or service.Â  Since it's the law anyway, why not make
it a benefit. Let them know that they are purchasing your
product or service RISK-FREE.
30) Instruct them to respond immediately.Â  Many people
just need to read those words, ""Act Now!""Â  ""Order today!""
""Click Here to Instantly Place Your Order.""Â  You've got them
this far, now tell them what you want them to do.Â  Get them
to ""Act Fast!""Â  Have you ever heard a mail order commercial
on television that didn't prompt the viewer to order right
way?
31) Include a post script.Â  People will always read the
P.S.Â  Always. In fact, the P.S. is one of the MOST IMPORTANT
parts of your sales letter. Why?Â  Because in many cases the
visitor at your website will scroll immediately down to the
end of your page to see how much it is going to cost.Â  A
P.S. is a perfect place to recap your offer, so when they
see your price tag, they will also see a very detailed
description of what they will receive for their money. Use
your P.S. to restate your offer in detail.
32) Include a second post script.Â  You better believe
if they read the first P.S., they will read a P.P.S.Â  Use
this post script to remind them of the deadline or offer
another bonus or point out some compelling factor that would
make them want to order.Â  I guarantee you they will read it.
Use these 32 tips and I guarantee you that you will see
a significant increase in the amount of responses you
receive from your sales letters.Â  In fact, it would be
impossible for your responses to not improve.

 CNETÂ TECH897.37 Â -48.86Techs fall again with telecoms, Dow drops below 8K
The day after WorldCom Group filed for bankruptcy protection, telecom shares suffered and helped drag down the tech sector.BellSouth stock tumbled 18.07 percent after it missed Wall Street's earnings target and offered a worse-than-expected outlook.  With shares of SBC Communications, Qwest Communications International, Sprint and AT&T also dropping, CNET's Tech index shed 48.86 points, or 5.3 percent, to 897.37. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index fell 36.5 points, or 2.77 percent, to 1,282.55.With a report raising questions about Citigroup and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.'s role in the Enron fiasco, broader markets lost ground as well. After a see-saw session, the Dow Jones industrials ended down 234.7 points, or 2.93 percent, to 7,784.5. The S&P 500 slid 27.90 points, or 3.29 percent, to 819.85.
BellSouth posts lower second-quarter profits 
BellSouth Corp., the No. 3 U.S. local telephone company, on Monday posted lower second-quarter profits due to slack demand and turbulent economic conditions in North America and Latin America.BellSouth, the dominant local telephone company in nine Southeastern states from Kentucky to Florida, said net income fell to 16 cents a share from 47 cents a year earlier. BELLSOUTH CORP 22.61 -18.11% WorldCom, BellSouth news adds to telecom gloom 
WorldCom Inc.'s bankruptcy filing is only the latest in a long line of sad news for a slumping telecom industry grappling with soft demand, falling earnings and worries about accounting.And things are not likely to change any time soon, as signaled by BellSouth Corp.'s disappointing second-quarter earnings and downward revision to its full-year outlook, analysts and investors said on Monday.WORLDCOM INC-WORLDCOM TRCK STK 0.14 55.56% HP seeks Texas justice; Gateway dinged 
In separate court cases, a Florida jury dinged Gateway for sending phone calls to the wrong business, and a federal court in Houston issued an injunction barring Emachines from selling products that infringe on Hewlett-Packard patents.
A jury in Florida ruled last week that Gateway must pay $3.6 million for a typo in which it sent customers with a PC problem to an 800 number owned by Pensacola, Fla.-based Mo' Money Associates instead of the company's own complaint line, which had a similar number but with an 888 prefix.HEWLETT-PACKARD CO 12.00 -6.25%

Analyst Mark FitzGerald expects the chip equipment maker to meet his revenue and earnings estimates of $225 million and 10 cents per share when it reports second-quarter results after the market close. He anticipates earnings guidance for the current quarter of 15-20 cents per share. The stock could move a bit higher, but FitzGerald believes better data from end markets is needed for a sustained rally. He also expects the firm to announce it will pay back $880 million in debt.NOVELLUS SYSTEMS 29.55 -0.81%

Tyco CFO's tenure seen ending as confidence wanes 
Tyco International Ltd.'s earnings release on Tuesday may very well be the last for Chief Financial Officer Mark Swartz, whose tenure has been marred by his close association with the conglomerate's disgraced former chairman.
Named CFO in 1995, Swartz has been the chief defender of Tyco's accounting, which has drawn fire for being opaque and misleading. But perhaps more important, Swartz was a key adviser and architect in Dennis Kozlowski's decade-long acquisition binge to build Tyco into one of the world's largest manufacturing conglomerates.TYCO INTERNATIONAL 11.85 -5.12%

  | From: Stephen Shirley 
  |[ ... ]
  | It's very easy to get one program to act on the output of a second
  | program: cmd1 | cmd2. But, what if you want cmd1 to act on the output
  | of cmd2 as well? Hmm. Eventually, I came up with this solution:
  | 
  |    mkfifo io
  |    cmd1  io
  | 
  | and bingo, all was well with the world. Now, I have (and had) a sneaking
  | suspcion that it might be possible to do this without using a fifo, and
  | can be done using something like:
  | 
 1|    exec 3>&1
 2|    cmd1 <&3 | cmd2 >&3
 3|    exec 3>&-
  | 
  | but that doesn't work in that form, and i couldn't work out an
  | incantation that would. Anyone got any suggestions?  [ ... ] the above, or something close to it, would work if, when the
 1st line is executed, file descriptor (fdesc) 1 is open for both
 read and write (R/W) to a suitable entity (e.g., a pipe/FIFO; I
 imagine a socket or something of that ilk could be made to work
 but have no idea why you'd want to go to the trouble.... ). but in any case, all that is unlikely to be the case:
  Â· most probably, fdesc 1 is yer tty (e.g. screen + keyboard);
 and
  Â· quite possibly is open only for write (being stdout). you need it open for R/W because all dup2(2) --- which is all
 `n>&m' means -- does is replicate the fdesc handle.  it does not
 change the access mode; e.g., if the original fdesc (m) was only
 open for writing (W), that's all the new fdesc (n) is open for.
 yet in the 2nd line, it's needed for both R (cmd1) and W (cmd2). whilst it's impossible to say for certain from this excerpt, it
 seems a reasonable guess that fdesc 1 when the 1st line executes
 is the stdout of the script itself, which is most probably yer
 tty.  that means, if it does happen to be open for R/W (which is
 the case on some systems), `cmd2' would be writing to the screen
 whilst `cmd1' is reading from the keyboard --- i.e., the poor
 confused human luser is ""clearly"" expected to manually echo back
 to the computer what it prints. good luck!  ;-) upshot:  the FIFO is needed.  and this isn't a shell scripting
          problem per se. the FIFO solution is fine.  I've used variations (plural) on
 this approach to extend the Korn (ksh(1)) shell language, by
 providing a co-processing interpreter --- `ksh' sends certain
 predefined commands to the co-process, handling control over
 to the co-process until it indicates processing is complete
 and `ksh' can resume normal processing.  with some thought and
 care to insure signals do something rational, works great for
 adding a scripting language (which is the purpose) cheaply to
 script-less programs (useful when you can't modify the, IMHO,
 buggy program to use, e.g., TCL).cheers!

"This is not directly SpamAssassin related, but more of a general
dealing-with-SPAM issue.What is the best way to deal with SPAM during the SMTP transaction?
There are domains and addresses that I know are SPAM at the 'MAIL
FROM' and can deal with at the SMTP level. I have been, and I think
most people, respond with a 5.7.1 code, a ""permanent"" error. That
pretty much means, ""Don't bother to try from that address again,
you'll get the same error."" People often add cathartic messages to
accompany the 550 like, ""Spammers must die.""But this might not be the best way to go. You are telling the spammers
that you are on to them. This may cause them to try other methods to
get around your blocks. Is it perhaps better to blackhole the mail?
That is, act like everything is OK during the SMTP transaction, but
then just drop the mail into the bitbucket. (This is generally how
SpamAssassin works since almost everyone uses it after the SMTP
transaction has completed successfully.) Spammer thinks everything is
going fine and has no reason to try new methods.Then there is a third possibility. Instead of returning a 550 code
indicating you're on to the spammer, fake a 5.1.1 response which is
saying ""mailbox does not exist."" This would be in the hopes that some
spammers out there actually remove names reported as non-existent from
their lists. I know, a slim hope, but even if only a few do, it can
lower the incidence.So, what are the arguments for each? Do spammers even look at _any_ of
the bounce messages they get? The volume of bounces must be
huge. Personally, I'm starting to think blackholes are the way to
go... But sending back that ""Spammer die, die, die,"" or stock ""Access
DEE-NIED!"" (my ephasis added) message can be pretty satisfying. ;)

Jobs touts OS X, iPods, iMacNEW YORK--Apple Computer CEO Steve Jobs on Wednesday defended the company's switch to the Mac OS X operating system and unveiled new iPod digital-audio players and a new flat-panel iMac.
Jobs used his keynote speech at the Macworld trade show here to make a flurry of other announcements as well, such as details about new syncing software, the next update to OS X and the end of free iTools.The most dramatic announcement focused on iPod. The new players include ones built specifically for computers that use Microsoft's Windows operating system.July 17, 2002, 8:30 AM PT
 | Read Full Story Scient files for Chapter 11 Internet consulting firm Scient has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and agreed to sell certain assets to a professional services firm.
The deal calls for Salt Lake City-based SBI to hire some of Scient's employees and to provide up to $4.9 million in financing, pending completion of the asset acquisition.Scient has been struggling for some time now. Once a dot-com darling, the company recently approved a 1-for-20 reverse stock split.

 | Read Full Story Yahoo Mail puts words in your mouthWhat does Yahoo Mail have against mocha?
That's what users of the company's free e-mail service may be wondering if they try to send a message using the word ""mocha"" and discover that while in transit, ""mocha"" mysteriously changes to ""espresso.""To protect users from malicious code, Yahoo uses an automated filter to swap out a handful of words such as ""mocha"" that pertain to Web code known as JavaScript.
The reason is that e-mail sent in a form known as ""Web enhanced"" can contain JavaScript instructions that can run programs on the recipient's PC. JavaScript is a Web language that can issue commands such as telling the browser to open up other windows or to prompt a service to change a password, for example.

 | Read Full Story New chip may portend ATI comebackATI, once the leader in graphics chips, will launch its comeback bid this week with a new chip that experts say could put the company back in front in terms of performance.
The Markham, Ontario-based company on Thursday will unveil the details of the Radeon 9700, a desktop graphics chip based on a new architecture that will provide greater realism when it comes to 3D images, according to sources.The fastest versions of the new chips will offer considerably higher performance than Nvidia's current GeForce4 roster, giving ATI the edge with gamers as well as PC makers, analysts said. And even after Nvidia--which began to chip away at ATI's leading spot in graphics in 1999--comes out with its GeForce 5 in a few months, the competition between the two will remain close.

>OK, but only if you also meant religious and alcoholic extremes ;)Since it was my quip, I'll point out that I used
the term ""alcoholism,"" implying addiction. I
drink. I'm not an alcoholic. Most people who drink
don't go to AA meetings. Most people who go to AA
meetings do (try very hard) not to drink.As to religion, I think it is harmful and risky in
almost any degree. Were I single, I might consider
potential mates who partook of the less irrational
or more light-hearted religions. A Unitarian or
Buddhist might be an example of the first, a Wiccan
of the second. But someone who is both irrational
and serious about that irrationality strikes me as
a bad choice of partner, moreso than someone who
was addicted to some drug. Alcoholics and drug
addicts at least have the sense to battle their
problem, and to keep their children from suffering
it. The religious revel in their irrationality,
and want to raise their children in it. That's a
difficult difference for two parents to
reconcile.Fortunately, I am long and happily enamored of
someone who has no religious tendencies.

The Wall Street JournalSeptember 23, 2002
COMMENTARYRebuild at Ground ZeroBy LARRY SILVERSTEINEarlier this month, we New Yorkers observed the solemn anniversary of the
horrific events that befell our city on Sept. 11, 2001. All of those who
perished must never be forgotten. The footprints of the fallen Twin Towers
and a portion of the 16-acre site must be dedicated to a memorial and civic
amenities that recall the sacrifices that were made there and the anguish
that those senseless acts of terror created for the victims' families and,
indeed, for all of us.But for the good of the city and the region, the 10-million-plus square
feet of commercial and retail space that was destroyed with the Twin Towers
must be replaced on the site.About 50,000 people worked in the World Trade Center. Those jobs are lost,
along with those of another 50,000 people who worked in the vicinity.
Together, those jobs in lower Manhattan, for which the Trade Center was the
economic stimulus, produced annual gross wages of about $47 billion, or 15%
of the annual gross wages earned in the entire state. Some of the firms
have relocated elsewhere in the city and region, but many have not. New
York City is facing a budget deficit. Without additional jobs, the deficit
may become permanent. This is one reason for the importance of rebuilding.If we do not replace the lost space, lower Manhattan never will regain the
vibrancy it had as the world's financial center. Love them or hate them,
and there were lots of New Yorkers on both sides of the issue, the Towers
made a powerful statement to the world that said, ""This is New York, a
symbol of our free economy and of our way of life."" That is why they were
destroyed. This is a second reason why the towers must be replaced, and
with buildings that make a potent architectural statement.In recent weeks, redevelopment proposals have been circulated from many
sources. Most of these focus not on the Trade Center site, however, but on
all of lower Manhattan. Further, many believe that the 10 million square
feet either could be located elsewhere, scattered in several sites, or
simply never rebuilt.These proposals miss the point. What was destroyed, and what must be
recovered, was the Trade Center, not all of lower Manhattan. Except over
the towers' footprints, where there must be no commercial development, the
office and retail space lost has to be rebuilt on or close to where it was.Access to mass transit makes the site ideal for office space of this size.
That was a major reason why the Twin Towers were leased to 97% occupancy
before 9/11. None of the other sites proposed for office development has
remotely equal transportation access. With the reconstruction of the subway
and PATH stations, plus an additional $4.5 billion in transit improvements
planned, such as the new Fulton Transit Center and the direct
""Train-to-the-Plane"" Long Island Rail Road connection, the site becomes
even more the logical locus of office development.And New York will need the space. Before 9/11, the Group of 35, a task
force of civic leaders led by Sen. Charles Schumer and former Treasury
Secretary Robert Rubin, concluded that the city would need an additional 60
million square feet of new office space by 2020 to accommodate the
anticipated addition of 300,000 new jobs. The loss of the Twin Towers only
heightens the need.As for those who say that 10 million square feet of office space downtown
cannot be absorbed by the real estate market, I would simply point out that
history shows them wrong. New York now has about 400 million square feet of
office space. All new construction underway already is substantially leased
up. New York had 48 million square feet of vacant office space at the
beginning of the recession in 1990. By 1998, this space had been absorbed,
at an annual rate of about 6 million square feet.We are seeking to rebuild 10 million square feet on the Trade Center site
over a period of about 10 years, with the first buildings not coming on
line until 2008 and the project reaching completion in 2012. This is an
annual absorption rate of about a million feet, much lower than the 1990s'
rate.Those who argue that New York cannot reabsorb office space that it
previously had are saying that the city has had its day and is entering an
extended period of stagnation and decline. I will not accept this view, nor
will most New Yorkers.Mayor Michael Bloomberg said in a recent interview with the New York Times
that the city ""has to do two things: memorialize, but also build for the
future."" I believe that the Twin Towers site can gracefully accommodate --
and that downtown requires -- office and retail space of architectural
significance, a dignified memorial that both witnesses and recalls what
happened, and cultural amenities that would benefit workers as well as
residents of the area.The challenge to accomplish this is enormous. But our city is up to the task.Mr. Silverstein is president of Silverstein Properties, a real estate firm
whose affiliates hold 99-year leases on the World Trade Center site.--

NO MORE XIMIAN, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES.  Man, that was annoying.    Anyway, I have returned to Redhat 7.3 on my root filesystem (saved my home directories, music and games on other partitions) and while I have the 8.0 stuff in the list, everything I want to upgrade requires 200+ RPMs.    I'm not opposed to this, but apt is.  ""apt-get dist-upgrade"" dumps core.    What's the inside secret here, or do I just start searching mirrors for the ISO and get over it?

"bilingualism i ' m not sure why , but i was reluctant to post on the issue of us bilingualism . in any case , i feel obliged to say this as an educational linguist who has worked in esl and tangentially in bilingual ed teacher education . first of all , the entire notion that bilingual ed was , is , or could be ( designed as ) a method for introducing national plurilingualism is a nonstarter . therefore any debates about it using plurilingualism as argument get nowhere . in fact , with out a wish to flame anyone ( because i do n't think it was intentional ) the entire argument that we should stop bilingual ed because of its anti - english or anti-standard english agenda is of a kind very familiar to us in educational circles . it 's little different than what we hear from those who argue that proponents of progressive educational idea x ( e . g . whole langauge reading instruction , process writing , outcomes-based ed . ) are trying to bring down standards , undermine society , do something unamerican , and so on . it is essentially a rhetorical manipulation of the worst kind , based on false suppositions , and intended to push hot buttons . by saying this i am not defending bilingual ed or any other movement . however , i think these need to be debated on their educational merits . why is the argument a nonstarter ? admittedly , there are those in education who propose that students have the right to their own dialect language or what-have - you , and that they should n't have to learn standard english in school . however , they are largely involved in an academic exercise that takes place in the pages of journals of various sorts . they do not shape policy . the avowed purpose of the vast majority of bilingual ed programs is usually to ease a limited english proficient child into the mainstream . the idea is that if they take content area courses in their first language they will not fall behind while learning english . the programs contain esl components that supposedly will allow the kids to mainstream later . some programs do encourage native language literacy and continue classes native language classes throughout a child 's school career . some take very young english speaking kids and put them into these classes on an immersion basis . since usually older english speaking kids in other schools are trying , in theory , to learn the same language the immigrant kids are already fluent in , i fail to see what is controversial about that . it seems to be designed , in theory again , to encourage personal , not societal , bilingualism . the failings of bilingual ed , in places where it has failed , have more to do with poor educational practice than with policy . if kids are arriving at college after say five years in bilingual ed , and are entering esl programs , something did n't work right . to anyone remotely familiar with urban schools , that should hardly be a surprise . now , on a national level i think we should look at us bilingualism and forget about catalonia or the basque country for a moment . bilingualism in the us has endured over many generations in several situations : ( i ) tight - knit religious communities : hasidic jews who speak yiddish , old order amish , brethren , and mennonites , who speak their german dialects . ( ii ) groups who were overtaken , to put it nicely , by english speakers : the navajo and other indigenious peoples ; french creole speakers in louisiana , spanish in the southwest . ( iii ) isolated communities : gullah in south carolina and georgia . immigrants , it would seem , tend to assimilate linguistically over a few , typically very few generations . in spite of the myth that spanish - speakers are somehow different on this score , i think , it would be instructive to look at the case of new york , which is full of people young hispanics who cannot speak more than a few words of spanish - this in spite of continuing immigration from spanish - speaking countries . as a non - yiddish or hebrew speaking ashkanazi jew , i entirely understand this phenomenon although as a learner of spanish as a foreign language , i lament the lost opportunity . finally , i think it would be more instructive to look at which americans feel threatened by the non-existent threat of the demise of something that has never existed ( the us as a monolingual nation ) and try to figure out why people feel that way . why , for example , is it an issue in the west and not in new york ? why is it associated with right and not the left ? why has it come up now again ? is it it really just good old american nativism , ' 90s style , or is there something different going on ? also , why have n't we in linguistics and education done more to communicate with mainstream americans that the whole thing is a lot of nonsense ? michael newman dept . of educational theory & practice the ohio state university mnewman @ magnus . acs . ohio-state . edu",Safe Email

"http://www.techcentralstation.com/1051/printer.jsp?CID=1051-100802BThe Disappearing Alliance
By Dale Franks 10/08/2002
For over two generations, the countries of Western Europe have been our
closest allies. We stood beside each other through the darkest days of the
Cold War as partners in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. We
celebrated with them over the fall of the Soviet Empire and the liberation
of Eastern Europe from the yoke of communism.Tragically, a generation from now, we may be bitter adversaries.Europe has increasingly fallen under the spell of a political ideology that
Hudson Institute scholar John Fonte has termed ""progressive
transnationalism"". The key doctrines of this form of post-communist
progressivism contain some fairly pernicious ideas. Among these are the
deconstruction of nationalism, the promotion of post-nationalist ideas of
citizenship (i.e. a ""global"" citizenry), a redefinition of democracy, and
the pooling of national sovereignty into multinational groups such as the
United Nations.The European Union, itself a multinational organization built through the
pooling of sovereignty by European nations, is post-democratic. While there
is a European Parliament, the EU's power resides mainly in the unelected
European Commission (EC) and its unelected President, who face few limits
to their power. Instead of a limited, consensual form of government, where
elected representatives promulgate constitutional laws, the EU has an
appointed, oligarchic executive, along with a large attendant bureaucracy,
whose orders are not constitutionally limited in any real sense. Moreover,
the EU has been unwilling to accept the democratically expressed wishes of
the people themselves when those wishes conflict with the results desired
by the EU's political elite. Both the EC and the European Court of Justice
regularly overturn the national laws of democratically elected EU member
governments. This is a step backward in Europe's political development.European criticism of America is on the rise, and the European list of
complaints about America is a long and growing one. They dislike the fact
that our republican system of government is not based on proportional
representation. They hate the fact that our citizens own guns. They despise
the fact that we execute murderers. They resent the fact that our economy
is so large, and that Americans consume so much. They also resent?and fear
- the fact that we have the ability to project American power anywhere
in the world.On August 9, 2002, Adrian Hamilton wrote a column in the UK's Independent
newspaper, in which he identified the US as a rogue state who should be
restrained, perhaps by a European military invasion, followed by a decade
or so of occupation. Fortunately, the article is satirical not because it
exaggerates the way European progressives view the US, but rather because
the impotence of European military power makes the idea of an invasion of
the US literally fantastic.At least, for now.Despite the tongue-in-cheek nature of this editorial, however, the fact
remains that America is increasingly viewed this way by the European
intellectual and political elite.The Europeans actively desire a world where the United Nations keeps in
check the activities of sovereign states. Because they have built such a
system in Europe, they feel it's valid for the rest of the world. America,
however, is the biggest obstacle to such a system. The Europeans cannot
understand why America places a higher value on the ethos of national
sovereignty and limited, consensual, and constitutional government, than it
does on compliance with international ""norms."" They view all departures
from such norms as aberrant. Because the UN member states all have an equal
vote in prescribing international norms, they assume that, since the
process is ostensibly legitimate, the results must be as well. The trouble
with this idea, of course, is that it gives the views of non-democratic,
authoritarian states the same weight as those of free, democratic
societies. It sanctifies the process, with no regard to the actual results.Thus, they are unable to make any moral distinction between the US refusals
to join in a given international effort because we wish to preserve the
liberty of our citizens, and similar refusals from Iraq because its
dictator wishes to maintain his firm grip on power. Our repeated references
to the US Constitution, and our unwillingness to bypass its provisions to
comply with international norms, are incomprehensible to them. They assume,
therefore, that our refusal is based on arrogance, rather than on a
commitment to
constitutional rights.None of this bodes well for the future of Euro-American friendship, or
cooperation. If the Europeans continue to reject traditional liberalism in
favor of the new progressivism, their criticism of the US will rise, while
their tolerance of our differences will fall. Obviously, in such a
political atmosphere, the opportunities for conflict will inevitably
increase.That thought is frightening enough. Even more frightening, however, is the
thought that such a conflict might be averted by our own acceptance of the
new ideology of transnational progressivism.

>Considering 90% of the fake job posting I see are for embedded systems or 
>device drivers - C still rules the world.There is a lot of C++ in the embedded world. With
static object allocation and a few other programming
techniques, performance differences disappear, but
C++ gives a boost in development and maintainability.
The real issue is compiler availability. Almost every
embedded platform has C cross-compilers. Many have
C++ compilers. But there is still a range of
platforms that have the first but not the second. Or
at least, that was the story a few years ago._________________________________________________________________

Inside HP 
Bluetooth: speeds up
July 9, 2002
Browse or bustThrough daily use I've found that Mozilla and Opera Web browsers beat Internet Explorer because of two features: tabbed windows and built-in pop-up killers. But occasionally I hit a site that has features that don't work or has a messed up layout, so I have to launch IE to view it correctly. In the last couple of years, Web builders have used proprietary code from Microsoft in their sites, which Mozilla and Opera don't support.I used to cover Web building, so I have plenty of insight into the problem. Using current, standard HTML and JavaScript, Web builders can make a Web site do almost anything that you could with Microsoft's proprietary code. The only things they can't do are goofy enhancements such as changing the browser scroll bar colors. To solve this compatibility problem, either Web builders have to take proprietary tags out of their sites or users have to use IE to view them. You can also enhance IE with utilities such as Secure IE to get the kinds of features offered by Mozilla and Opera, giving you the best of both worlds.Who do you think should be solving problems of Web site incompatibility: Web builders, users, or browser manufacturers? Let me know at edit@download.com.Wayne Cunningham

""Doomed. Completely, absolutely, utterly!""
Just about everyone agreed that Audiogalaxy is as dead as Napster.""Each time a file-sharing service is canceled, a bunch of new ones appear.""
But some people always find a silver lining.""I might use a file-sharing service for a lot of things, particularly drivers, fixes, and patches.""
A P2P network offering drivers seems like a great idea to me.""I was an occasional Audiogalaxy participant (birthday CD burned to include songs that were hits the year you were born). Now I'll just opt for a birthday card and a bottle of wine.""
I included this comment because I really like the birthday idea.""It seems once again rather than release a file download site for music, at a fee per download, the music companies spend money on trying to stop download sites like Audiogalaxy.""
With its popularity, file swapping should be an amazing opportunity for record companies, but they must not be smart enough to figure out how to make it work.

Symphony Telecom (OTCBB: SYPY) went UP 100% in just one week!!!
InDigiNet Identifies 
Acquisition Targets with Combined Revenues of $35 Million...
Â 
Telecom Consolidation Begins to Accelerate The Wall Street Bulletin believes 
that the recent 
investment of capital into Level 3, lead by Warren Buffett, 
is further proof of the continued validity of the telecommunication 
market when looked at from the perspective of the small to mid-sized 
enterprises. After the boom and bust comes the revival. For some 
carriers drowning in debt, such as Global Crossing and WorldCom, 
the future may be dim. But for those survivors of the industry 
that have managed to remain on their feet, other companies' problems 
mean opportunity. ""Every major industry in the history of 
the United States has experienced a similar transformation, from 
the railroads in the late 1800s to the automakers in the mid-1900s 
to the Dot-Coms at the end of the 20th century,"" says Robert 
Saunders, director of the Eastern Management Group market 
research firm. Christopher 
Dean, CTO of OSS company Eftia, says ""We are seeing all 
the people that are the survivors. There's all this pent-up money 
and for the surviving carriers out there, they can get what used 
to cost a few billion for a few millions."" Read the full 
story from Telecommunications Magazine - See the link at the end 
of this newsletter. 
As we write this report, our New Recommendation 
InDigiNet, Inc. (OTCBB: 
IGTT) has only been trading on the OTC Bulletin Board since 
late May of 2002. As InDigiNet, Inc. continues to implement its 
business plan, we believe this company will help lead the way 
up for the resurgence of the Telecom Sector. This could be our 
strongest recommendation of the year. We are giving IGTT our Highest 
Rating of STRONG BUY/AGGRESSIVE GROWTH.
Â 
Ground Floor Opportunity / Tremendous 
Growth Potential 
We believe IGTT will perform equally to, if not 
greater than its competition. A similar telecommunications company, 
Talk America Holdings (Nasdaq: TALK), share 
price began to explode in April of this year moving from just 
over $0.40/share to over $4.00/share in late June. Talk America 
Holdings previously had a market cap of only $24.51 million, but 
today has a market cap of $267 million.
IGTT curently has a market cap of $22.42 million. 
Using the TALK model for potential growth, IGTT could very well 
be trading in the .60 range in only a few months, with a market 
cap in excess of $250 million. This would be an increase of 1000%. 
So you see why IGTT has such great potential and the time is right 
 for investors to get in on the ground floor.
Â 
The InDigNet Strategy
InDigiNet, Inc. is an integrated solutions company 
that provides small to mid-sized enterprises (SMEs) with an integrated 
communication solution. InDigiNet is a prestigious ""Diamond"" 
level partner of Avaya, as well as a reseller for Cisco and 
Compaq. The Company will offer data, local, long distance and 
wireless services to SMEs over third party networks enabling the 
Company to offer a comprehensive suite of services without the 
capital burden of building a communication network. The Companyâ€™s 
strategy is to acquire the customer bases of smaller, single market 
communication companies and attractively priced Internet 
Service Providers (ISPs). The Company recently completed 
its acquisitions of Fox Telecommunications and WBConnect. 
InDigiNet will then expand the breadth of their services to grow 
revenue and enhance profitability. SMEs account for $120 billion 
in commercial telephony, data services and technology spending, 
or 33% of the countryâ€™s total market, and this spending 
is expected to grow at above average rates over the next ten years.

Â 
The IT Market
Based on recent studies, the countryâ€™s 7.4 
million SMEs currently lag significantly in the utilization of 
IT and data 
communications, including Internet access, web services, business 
software and e-commerce. Worldwide IT spending increased to $981 
billion US for the year, an overall increase of 3.7 percent over 
2001, according to a study released 7/24/2002 by market researcher 
IDC. IT spending in 2003 is expected to reach record heights, 
growing by 9 percent worldwide to top the $1 trillion mark for 
the first time. In IDC's revised forecasts for IT spending in 
2002 and 2003, IT spending in the US is expected to increase by 
3 percent this year over 2001 to $436 billion, with further growth 
of 9 percent in 2003. Western Europe can expect growth of 4 percent 
in 2002 and 6 percent in 2003. Though Japan will experience flat 
growth levels this year, by next year growth in the market will 
return to the tune of 7 percent with particular strength shown 
in China, India, Korea, Russia, the Philippines, South Africa 
and Poland. Source: IDC
Â 
Particulars
The Wall Street Bulletin is putting IGTT on our 
Strong Buy/Aggressive Growth recommendation list for the following 
reasons:
1. The Company's strategy is to acquire the customer 
bases of smaller, single-market communication companies and attractively 
priced Internet Service Providers (ISPs). The Company will sell 
its bundled service package to the acquired customer base that 
will form a direct and immediate distribution channel for all 
types of communication services - local, long distance, wireless, 
and data. 2. The Company is currently serving many customers in the Denver/Front 
Range communities but in particular the education vertical market 
has recognized the value of integrating a wireless broadband data 
network into the existing campus network. The Company's customers 
include United States Olympic Committee 
(USOC), University of Denver, 
and Colorado State University. 
3. The Company has identified approximately $35,000,000 in revenues 
to acquire comprised of distressed assets to be auctioned in bankruptcy 
court and smaller communication providers with valuable customer 
bases. Each of the targeted companies are within the Company's 
footprint and will, subject to purchase completion, increase the 
Company's embedded customer base. 
Â 
Investment Consideration
InDigiNet Inc recently filed its 10QSB, for the 
three months ended March 31, 2002. IGTT reported Revenues of $339,694 
in Q1 2002 vs. Revenues of $0 in Q1 2001. At this current growth 
rate, revenues should grow above $1.3 million for their first 
year of production with no increases in acquisitions. As more 
and more large corporations come under government scrutiny, investors 
will turn to small to mid-sized companies with their investment 
dollars.

kulka , department of communication , hebrew university , jerusalem , israel . the goal of the colloquium is to bring together ethnographic , discourse analytical and interactional sociolinguistic perspectives to discuss the role of context and culture in the discursive shaping of oral narrative modes and functions . the papers presented will attempt to combine micro-level with macro-level analytic concerns , and their scope will cover a wide range of oral narrative modes ( e . g . conversational stories , life histories , mediated discourse narratives , family dinner narratives ) in different communities . papers will be presented by catherine snow , shoshana blum - kulka , alexandra georgakopoulou , esther schelly - newman and tamar katriel . the discussants of the presentations will include johanna thornborrow , maria sifianou , mike baynham and paddy scannell . 5 . disability , language & social identity convenor : graham h . turner , deaf studies group , department of education studies , university of central lancashire , preston this interdisciplinary colloquium sets out to address questions raised by claims about ' deaf identity ' - in the sense of an identity shaped by distinct linguistic and cultural forms - and other disabled identities , by focusing upon the role of language in discourse practices that construct and reflect such identities . does the language currently used by and about disabled people ( including deaf people ) sustain the distinction , and what part does language play in any changes being witnessed ? in spite of the existence of theoretical deaf and disability literature , relatively little has to date emerged by way of empirical accounts of language choices in either personal or institutional discourse , and there has been little theorization of language practices in such contexts . while sociolinguists ' discussions of ( for instance ) ethnicities move on from the debate about group-membership - as-acquired - disposition versus group-membership - as-situated - performance , there remains little exploration of even these two notions in relation to language and disability . the purpose of this colloquium is to assess the state of knowledge in this field and to begin to explore ( a ) the role of disabled people in effecting language change , ( b ) the extent to which communicative practices are defining in relation to disabled identities , ( c ) what ( if any ) patterns emerge from the cross-referencing of different groups in this regard and ( d ) what kinds of research could tell us more about the role of language in constructing and performing disability . within this session ( which will have british sign language / english interpretation ) four 25 - minute papers will be followed by short independent responses from two discussants and an open workshop session for exploration of issues arising . contributors include : jenny corbett , mairian corker , susan gregory , & kyra pollitt . 6 . computer - mediated communication , language and society convenor : dr . simeon j . yates , discipline of sociology , faculty of social sciences , open university . the colloquium will cover a range of sociolinguistic topics relating to the use of computer - mediated communication ( cmc ) in contemporary society . cmc systems range from the personal forms of electronic mail and internet-relay chat , through on-line forms of audio and video conferencing , to the world wide web and other digital media formats . the aim of the colloquium is to explore , through the discussion of presented papers , the connections between language use , cmc and key aspects of contemporary society , such as : globalisation , work , politics , identity , gender and media genres . this colloquium represents a development of the session on the socio-linguistics of computer - mediated communication ( cmc ) held at ss11 , and will provide an opportunity for researchers in this field to present and discuss current theories and findings . the focus of the session will be upon the relationship between contemporary society , contemporary language use and the various forms of cmc . speakers will include : simeon j . yates , susan herring , john paolillo , lynn cherny , lorenzo mondada , robert fouser , zazie todd , p . nayar & jacqueline johnson lambiase . . 7 . maintaining indigenous languages , with special reference to latin america - state planning vs grass - roots initiatives : convenors : jane freeland ( univ of portsmouth ) & rosaleen howard - malverde ( univ of liverpool ) latin american governments are giving increasing attention to the maintenance of indigenous langauges , mainly through formal education . however , outcomes frequently clash with , are even destructive of , language maintenance strategies developed by organised indigenous groups . this workshop will explore the relationship between these different approaches , through a series of brief case studies ( pre-circulated ) , but above all through extensive discussionof the language planning issues raised by this clash . speakers will include : kendall king , sheila aikman , serafin coronel - molina , tim marr & eliseo canulef m . 8 . language & multimodality convenor : prof . gunther kress , culture communication and societies ( ccs ) group , institute of education , london texts in many domains of public communication are becoming more intensely multimodal : that is , they make a deliberate use of the visual as well as the written ( where before that might have been an incidental matter ) for overt purposes of communication . social difference therefore finds expression not only in the linguistic mode whether written or spoken ( as in generic or discursive differences , eg ) but in other modes . different combinations , different emphases of modes may respond to different social purposes , so that even at this level there is a new issue of what the consequences are for language . if in a multimodal text some information is carried visually and some verbally - where before it was all carried verbally - it follows that language will play a different role in the overtly multi modal text than it did in the formerly ( at least ostensibly ) monomodal text . other participants : theo van leeuwen , david graddol , roz ivanic & fiona ormerod , radan martinec , carey jewitt , and judy delin . 9 . teaching & learning bilingually in post - colonial contexts convenors : marilyn martin - jones , university of lancaster & peter martin , universiti brunei darussalam . over the last decade , there has been an increasing amount of research into language practices in schools and classrooms in a number of post-colonial contexts . in each of these multililngual contexts , a former colonial language is still used as a medium of instruction . the aim of this colloquium is to bring together researchers working in different multilingual sites and to enable them to compare insights from research which combines detailed analysis of bilingual classroom discourse with ethnographic observation . our specific objectives are ( 1 ) to compare the ways in which teachers and learners in these settings accomplish lessons in two languages ; ( 2 ) to identify commonalities and differences in bilingual discourse practices observed and analysed in different institutional sites ; ( 3 ) to discuss the implications of these commonalities and differences . contributors include : casimir rubagumya , grace bunyi & nancy hornberger , angel lin & jo arthur , in addition to the convenors . 10 . language play & the construction of meaning among working class teenagers in hong kong . convenor : angel lin , city university of hong kong . other contributors will include isaac lam , michelle kwan , tit - wing lo & kevin chu , with chris candlin as discussant . 11 . there will also be a postgraduate workshop , convened by kristina bennert , of university college , cardiff . bennert @ cardiff . ac . uk . further details on programme by post : the full provisional programme is now being sent by post to people as they register , along with local travel details , and hotel booking arrangements . on the internet : our website is being updated regularly until the event itself , and you can find us at : http : / / www . ioe . ac . uk / ccs / ss12 papers as well as the colloquia , the programme includes c60 35 -

Date: Not suppliedI just finished reading an article about Mozilla[1] for Salon.com[2]. This 
excerpt was rather amusing._It is a good question, because in almost every way, Mozilla is a better 
browser than Navigator. For example, Netscape's best new feature, tabbed 
browsing -- which lets you have several Web pages open in the same browser 
window, and allows you to bookmark all the pages under one name -- was in 
Mozilla many months ago, and the Mozilla project that created it (called 
MultiZilla) already has an improved version available. When asked about this, 
Yecies, of Netscape, said, ""That's true, but the engineer who's working on it 
[for Mozilla] is a Netscape employee. It was always done with the intention of 
fostering general browsing usability for Netscape."" 
_
Yes, ok, I suppose that's true if by ""Netscape employee"" you really meant 
""Apple employee."" and by ""always done with the intention of fostering general 
browsing usability for Netscape"" you meant ""was done in a weekend for Mozilla 
because I thought MultiZilla was cool."" Here's how the whole tabbed browsing thing happened. One night I finally 
downloaded an extension called MultiZilla (go check it out on mozdev.org[3]. I 
was particularly impressed with a feature contained in MultiZilla called tabbed 
browsing. I started doing research and discovered NetCaptor[4], a tabbed 
browser that embedded WinIE. MultiZilla was cool but at the time suffered from two fundamental flaws that 
prevented the code from being incorporated into the Mozilla tree. The first was 
a UI flaw, namely that at the time it had ripped off NetCaptor down to the last 
context menu item. The GUI was similar enough that there would have been 
definite concerns about so obviously copying some of NetCaptor's more obscure 
capabilities (like sticky names and tab locking). The second concern was that 
the tab behavior wasn't encapsulated cleanly into a widget. I produced a simplified version of tabbed browsing on my own time (did it in a 
weekend) that removed some of the geekier NetCaptor features and that 
encapsulated the tab behavior so that the changes to other Navigator files 
would be minimal. Once I established that it didn't degrade performance in the 
single tab case, I checked it in as an experiment.The response was overwhelming, as were the bugs that started being filed. So 
much so that at first I wanted to back tabbed browsing out of the tree. I was 
overruled by Mozilla, which turned out to be a good thing for all I think. :) 
Even with all the excitement and hoopla surrounding the advent of tabbed 
browsing on the engineering side (and in the Mozilla community), Netscape still 
didn't get it. Netscape marketing prioritized all sorts of useless work that 
nobody had even started above tabbed browsing in their marketing document. They 
continued to do so for months, simply not getting it. It was this odd curiosity 
that one of their engineers had checked in, and they didn't know what to make 
of it.Only after the press raved about it did Netscape really jump on board. I'm sure 
Netscape is doing the same thing now with popup blocking. Can't you just see it 
now? We'll have a Popup Manager, and a Manager to manage the Popup Manager, and 
twenty-seven preferences for fine-grained control of all aspects of popups. Can you believe how disfunctional Netscape is? When their engineers say ""you 
should do this"" or ""you should do that"", they get completely ignored (or blown 
off), but when CNet says ""We didn't like this, or we didn't like that."", 
Netscape scurries to meet their demands. That is simply pathetic.[1] http://archive.salon.com/tech/feature/2002/09/10/browser_wars/

^kernel$ matches ""kernel"" and nothimg more.
Kerne, kernel-smp and kernel-enterprise are the kernel packages you
might be running in a RH system. Packages like kernel-headers,
kernel-BOOT and kernel-doc aren't matched. If it just said ""kernel"", it
would match *all* those packages.--

"" confidence has been shaken by the incremental disclosure . this is an extremely widely held stock and to assume that everybody listened to the conference call is probably asking too much , "" said one analyst who asked not to be identified . the reduction in equity was prominently reported in the wall street journal on thursday , bringing it to the attention of a wider audience , analysts said . lay said the equity writedown and a corresponding reduction in the number of enron shares outstanding were related to the early termination of structured finance arrangements which had drawn criticism from some wall street analysts . as a result of the operation , enron ' s debt to total capitalization ratio will rise to about 50 percent , but the company expects the proceeds of asset sales to reduce the ratio to around 40 percent by the end of next year , lay said . moody ' s investor service said earlier this week that it had placed all of enron ' s long - term debt obligations on review for a possible downgrade because writedowns and charges had substantially reduced valuations for several enron businesses . some of enron ' s financing arrangements require the company to maintain investment grade credit ratings . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . brazil ' s copene , elektro plan to sell 820 mln reais of bonds 2001 - 10 - 18 13 : 53 ( new york ) rio de janeiro , oct . 18 ( bloomberg ) - - two brazilian companies have asked securities regulators for permission to sell 820 million reais ( $ 279 million ) of bonds , raising the amount of pending local market bond sales to 7 . 5 billion reais . brazil ' s copene - petroquemica do nordeste sa , a petrochemical company , has asked brazil ' s government for permission to sell 625 million reais of bonds according to the country ' s security and exchange regulator , the cvm . banco citibank sa , the brazilian unit of citigroup inc . , will manage the sale . elektro eletricidade e servicos sa , an electricity utility controlled by u . s . - based enron corp . that distributes electricity in sao paulo state , has asked for permission to sell 195 million reais of bonds , according to a cvm filing . no further details about the sales was immediately available . brazilian companies have scrambled to sell debt at home as the local currency , the real , plunges against the dollar , making dollar - denominated debt expensive and causing losses to mount as the local currency value of dollar debts soars . so far this year , about 9 . 1 billion reais of local market debt has been sold . meanwhile corporate bond sales in euros or dollars has slipped by almost two thirds to $ 1 . 7 billion in the third quarter from $ 4 . 5 billion in the second , not including sales through offshore subsidiaries , according to bloomberg data .",Safe Email

Amanda Jones.-  My dear, since Eve picked the apple, no woman has ever been taken entirely 
unawares.-  This is Tommy. He tells people he's named after a gun, but I know he's named 
after a famous 19th century ballerina.-  When one woman strikes at the heart of another she seldom misses, and the 
wound is invariably fatal.-  I've never been alone with a man before, even with my dress on. With my 
dress off, it's _most_ unusual.-  You're nothing to me now. You're not a brother, you're not a friend. I don't 
want to know you or what you do. I don't want to see you at the hotels, I don't 
want you near my house. When you see our mother, I want to know a day in 
advance, so I won't be there.-  Kids: 10 seconds of joy, 30 years of misery.-  Sucking all the marrow out of life doesn't mean choking on the bone.-  A hundred million terrorists in the world and I gotta kill one with feet 
smaller than my sister.-  Mother, I do not need a blind date. Particularly not with some verbally 
incontinent spinster who drinks like a fish, smokes like a chimney and dresses 
like her mother.-  Have you ever seen a body like this before in your life?
She happens to be my daughter.
Oh. Then I guess you have.-  I'm not a smart man, but I know what love is.-  Of course, you won't be able to lie on your back for a while but then you 
can lie from any position, can't you?-  The fact that you prevented it from happening doesn't change the fact that 
it was going to happen.-  Women need a reason for having sex. Men just need a place.-  You are not special. You are not a beautiful or unique snowflake. You are 
the same decaying organic matter as everything else.-  Looks like I picked the wrong week to stop sniffing glue! -  The issue is not whether you are paranoid. Look around you Lenny. The issue

[Why was it that] a significant rate of capital formation was possible only in certain sectors and not in the whole market economy of the time? ... It would perhaps be teasingly paradoxial to say that whatever was in short supply, money certainly was not ... so this was an age where poor land was bought up and magnificent country residents built ... [How do we] resolve the contradiction ... between the depressed economic climate and the splendors of Florence under Lorenzo the Magnificent? --------------De Soto's theory is that the Bell Jar is formed when you segregate those who have *practical* access to legal property rights and those who do not. The poor[1] have property -- lots and lots of property. What they don't have is access to the systems where we turn property into capital and allow it to start growing. Their property can only be exchanged with a small section of people who know them personally.[1] Actual poor people, not 'poor' Americans with a living standard that is the envy of most of the world. http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork",Safe Email

Lennon killer seeks parole againThe man who shot dead former Beatle John Lennon is making another bid for
early release from prison - the day before what would have been Lennon's
62nd birthday.
Mark David Chapman, 47, was jailed for life after he admitted killing the
superstar outside his New York apartment building in 1980.
It is the second time in two years that Chapman has sought parole from
Attica state prison.
At a 2000 hearing, he argued that he was no longer a danger to society and
had overcome the psychological problems which led him to shoot the
ex-Beatle.
Chapman had said that a voice in his head told him to shoot the star.
Shot dead
Lennon was shot four times as he emerged from a limousine outside his New
York City apartment on 8 December 1980.
He and his wife Yoko Ono were returning from a late-night recording session
during which time they had been working on Walking on Thin Ice.
Only hours before the shooting, Chapman - who had come to New York from
Hawaii - was photographed with the singer outside the same building as
Lennon signed a copy of his album Double Fantasy for him.
The killer said Lennon had been just ""a picture on an album cover"" to him
before the shooting.
'Deserved death'
Chapman has said that he should have received the death penalty for his
crime.
Lennon's widow told the 2000 parole hearing that she would not feel safe if
Chapman were released.
Lennon's songwriting partnership with Paul McCartney propelled the
Liverpool-based pop group to international stardom and unparalleled
commercial success.
The Beatles front man, peace campaigner, and all-round iconoclast, would
have been 62 on Wednesday.------------------------ Yahoo! Groups Sponsor ---------------------~-->

"A while ago I asked what other packages I should optomize for Pentium. One 
person answered GlibC. This got me thinking about GCC itself, so I asked on 
another list and got a few answers, most were ""don't even think about it"" but 
a few suggested GCC and one pointed me to Linux From Scratch.After having a good search around the lfs site, I've decided I'm going to 
give it a whirl. I've got a spare box and loads of free time, so why not ;-)The lfs site, however warns NOT to use optimizations when compiling GCC or 
GlibC? A quick google found PGCC, a Pentium optimizing patch for GCC, but the 
site does not seem to have been updated in quite some time?So, my general plan, and I'm taking my time with this:Partition the hard drive for the lfs set-up with 4 partitions, /, /usr, /var 
and /home.
Install a base Debian system into the /home  partition so I can build the 
rest of the system into the other partitions.
Using Debian, build the initial packages into the / and /usr partitions. I'll 
try to optimize GCC and GlibC in this first stage.
chroot to the / partition and re-build the base packages for shared libs.
strip de-bugging from the binaries and change the boot so the system boot 
from / rather than /home, then move /home to it's proper partition.All going well, I should now have a full base Linux system running that is 
fully optimized for my PentiumMMX including GCC and GlibC.Now I can build zlib and then X, again optimizing. And I can follow this with 
the various graphics libs, qt lib and finally KDE.If all goes well, I will probably repeate this for my Dual system, once I can 
find a match for the slot1 550Mhz PIII Iv'e got.I might even be tempted to write this up for the site.Cheers,	John Gay--

This is a good thing.  Getting hammered for stupid investments is likely
to result in smarter investments in the future.  Nobody is supposed to
win all the time, particularly not people who don't do due diligence. 
""A fool and his money are soon parted"" and all that.  It isn't the job
of the FTC/SEC/IRS/etc to make sure you invest your money wisely (and I
have grave doubts that they could even if it was their job).

So what?  Nobody is guaranteed employment.  Laying people off is not a
crime nor is it immoral.  Companies don't exist to provide employment,
nor should they.  The closest we have to such a thing in the US is a
Government Job, and look at the quality THAT breeds.

"So, like many young children, my daughter Tatum (age 21 months) *really*
likes music. She also likes to have control over her environment, and this
means she wants to be the one putting CDs into the CD player, and getting
the music playing.By watching Tatum, I've discovered that you can learn a lot about UI design
from watching 21-month-olds use technology. There is definitely a market
niche for a toddler-friendly CD/MP3 player.The CD player we have combines play and pause in a single button, but
doesn't provide *instantaneous* feedback that the button was pushed, instead
requiring you to wait until the music starts, 5-10 seconds. This is a UI
disaster. Since Tatum doesn't get feedback right away, she presses the
button again, thereby pausing the CD before it even plays. She'll only ever
get music if she presses the button an odd number of times. This happens a
surprising amount of the time, since she eventually hits the button again
when the music doesn't play.For toddlers, pressing play must cause the music to start immediately,
within half a second, for the toddler to get the causality and not press the
button multiple times. As well, pressing the button multiple times shouldn't
change the semantics, like an elevator button. No matter how many times you
press, the elevator still comes to that floor. The play button needs to be
the same.The back-hinged door mechanism feeding the CD into the player is also a UI
disaster for Tatum. Since the door hinges on the back, Tatum has to angle
CDs to put them in, and take them out. Putting CDs in isn't much of a
problem, but taking them out is. Since Tatum grabs CDs by the back edge,
that edge comes out first, hitting the lid. Tatum eventually forces and
wiggles the CD out, a process that's hard on the CD and the player (but
which hasn't yet resulted in the CD player being broken). Surprisingly, it
hasn't been a problem getting the CD hole onto the spindle -- Tatum seems to
understand this concept, and the CD load area geometry naturally guides the
CD.Tatum's CD player also plays tapes and has FM radio. For a toddler, this is
a mistake. Tatum doesn't understand the need to flick a switch to put the
player into a specific mode. She understands putting a CD in, and pressing
the play button. She sometimes understands the buttons for advancing a song,
but uses them erratically. As well, the radio feature has both FM mono and
FM stero, a distinction totally lost on Tatum. Tatum only understands the
binary distinction of music/no music.What would the ideal toddler CD player be like? It would immediately start
playing a CD after it was loaded. As soon as the CD load door was closed, it
would give some audible feedback. It would have a single large play button.
The other typical CD controls would be larger than normal, but at least half
the size of the play button, and located far away from the play button, so
there is no chance of them getting accidentally pressed on the way to play.
The play button would be a bright color that is different from the color of
the player, and different from the color of the other CD control keys. The
device would only play CDs, no other functions. The CD load area would flip
open at least 80 degrees. It should be small, approachable for a toddler. It
should be possible to repeatedly drop the player from a height of 1-2'
without affecting the player.- Jim

"While wandering through Uppsala, Sweden last week, I ran across the
""Keramik"" studio of Paula von Freymann. Her pottery work has the theme of
""fossils for the future"", and she has two main lines of this work. One is
more conventional, taking leaves from plants at the nearby Linneas Gardens
and impressing them into the clay before firing, leaving a ""fossil"" of the
plant.The other is more unique, taking imprints of circuit boards, cellular
telephones, punched cards, etc. and then firing the result to make ""IT
fossils."" Given how quickly most of our work becomes obsolete, I found the
offbeat notion of IT fossilization an oddly fitting way of archiving the
physical detritus of the digital age.http://www.kuai.se/~itart/
